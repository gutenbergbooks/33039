<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SHERIFF RIDES TO WAR</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>M</span>ANY men swore that The Orphan was bad,
and many swore profanely and with
wonderful command of epithets because he was bad, but for obvious reasons
that was as far as the majority went to show their displeasure. Those of
the minority who had gone farther and who had shown their hatred by rash
actions only proved their foolishness; for they had indeed gone far and
would return no more.</p>

<p>Tradition had it that The Orphan was a mongrel,
a half-breed, asserting that his mother had
been a Sioux with negro blood in her veins. It
also asserted that his father had been nominated
and unanimously elected, by a posse, to an elevated
position under a tree; and further, that The
Orphan himself had been born during a cloudburst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
at midnight on the thirteenth of the month.
The latter was from the Mexicans, who found
great delight in making such terrifying combinations
of ill luck.</p>

<p>But tradition was strongly questioned as to his
mother, for how could the son of such a mother
be possessed of the dare-devil courage and grit
which had made his name a synonym of terror?
This contention was well stated and is borne out,
for it can be authoritatively said that the mother
of The Orphan was white, and had neither Indian
nor negro blood in her veins, but on the contrary
came from a family of gentlefolk. Thus I start
aright by refuting slander. The Orphan was
white, his profanity blue, and his anger red, and
having started aright, I will continue with the
events which led to the discovery of his innate
better qualities and their final ascendency over the
savagely hard nature which circumstances had
bred in him. These events began on the day when
James Shields, for reasons hereinafter set forth,
became actively interested in his career.</p>

<p>Shields, by common consent Keeper of the Law
over a territory as large as the State of New Jersey
and whom out of courtesy I will call sheriff, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
no coward, and neither was he a fool; and when
word came to him that The Orphan had made a
mess of two sheep herders near the U Bend of the
Limping Water Creek, he did not forthwith pace
the street and inform the citizens of Ford&#8217;s Station
that he was about to start on a journey which
had for its object the congratulation of The
Orphan at long range. Upon occasions his taciturnity
became oppressive, especially when grave
dangers or tense situations demanded concentration
of thought. The more he thought the less
he talked, the one notable exception being when
stirred to righteous anger by personal insults, in
which case his words flowed smoothly along one
channel while his thoughts gripped a single idea.
To his acquaintances he varied as the mood
directed, often saying practically nothing for
hours, and at other times discoursing volubly. One
thing, a word of his, had become proverbial&#8211;when
Shields said &#8220;Hell!&#8221; he was in no mood for pleasantries,
and the third repetition of the word meant
red, red anger. He was a man of strong personality,
who loved his friends in staunch, unswerving
loyalty; and he tolerated his enemies until the last
ditch had been reached.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>He, like The Orphan, was essentially a humorist
in the finest definition of the term, inasmuch as he
could find humor in the worst possible situations.
He was even now forcibly struck with the humor
of his contemplated ride, for The Orphan would
be so very much surprised to see him. He could
picture the expression of weary toleration which
would grace the outlaw&#8217;s face over the sights, and
he chuckled inwardly as he thought of how The
Orphan would swear. He did his shooting as an
unavoidable duty, a business, a stern necessity; and
he took great delight in its accuracy. When he
shot at a man he did it with becoming gravity, but
nevertheless he radiated pride and cheerfulness
when he hit the man&#8217;s nose or eye or Adam&#8217;s apple
at a hundred yards. All the time he knew that the
man ought to die, that it was a case of necessity,
and this explains why he was so pleased about the
eye or nose or Adam&#8217;s apple.</p>

<p>With The Orphan popular opinion said it was
far different; that his humor was ghastly, malevolent,
murderous; that he shot to kill with the same
gravity, but that it was that of icy determination,
chilling ferocity. He was said to be methodical
in the taking of innocent life, even more accurate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
than the sheriff, wily and shrewd as the leader of a
wolf-pack, and equally relentless. The Orphan
was looked upon as an abnormal development of
the idea of destruction; the sheriff, a corrective
force, and almost as strong as the evil he would
endeavor to overcome. The two came as near to
the scientists&#8217; little joke of the irresistible force
meeting the immovable body as can be found in
human agents.</p>

<p>So Shields, upon hearing of The Orphan&#8217;s latest
manifestation of humor, appreciated the joke to
the fullest extent and made up his mind to play a
similar one on the frisky outlaw. He could not
help but sympathize with The Orphan, because
every man knew what pests the sheepmen were,
and Shields, at one time a cowman, was naturally
prejudiced against sheep. He was exceedingly
weary of having to guard herds of bleating grass-shavers
which so often passed across his domain,
and he regarded the sheep-raising industry as an
unnecessary evil which should by all rights be
deported. But he could not excuse The Orphan&#8217;s
crude and savage idea of deportation. The sheriff
was really kind-hearted, and he became angry when
he thought of the outlaw driving two thousand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
sheep over the steep bank of the Limping Water
to a pitiful death by drowning; The Orphan
should have been satisfied in messing up the
anatomy of the herders. He did not like a glutton,
and he would tell the outlaw so in his own way.</p>

<p>He walked briskly through his yard and called
to his wife as he passed the house, telling her that
he was going to be gone for an indefinite period,
not revealing the object of his journey, as he did not
wish to worry her. Accustomed as she was to have
him face danger, she had a loving wife&#8217;s fear for
his safety, and lost many hours&#8217; sleep while he was
away. He took his rifle from where it leaned
against the porch and continued on his way to the
small corral in the rear of the yard, where two
horses whisked flies and sought the shade. Leading
one of them outside, he deftly slung a saddle
to its back, secured the cinches and put on a light
bridle. Dropping the Winchester into its saddle
holster, he mounted and fought the animal for a
few minutes just as he always had to fight it. He
spun the cylinders of his .45 Colts and ran his
fingers along the under side of his belt for assurance
as to ammunition. Seeing that the black
leather case which was slung from the pommel of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
the saddle contained his field glass and that his
canteen was full of water, he rode to the back door
of his house, where his wife gave him a bag of
food. Promising her that he would take good care
of himself and to return as speedily as possible, he
cantered through the gate and down the street
toward the &#8220;Oasis,&#8221; the door of which was always
open. Two dogs were stretched out in the doorway,
lazily snapping at flies. As the sheriff drew
rein he heard snores which wheezed from the barroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Dan!&#8221; he cried loudly. &#8220;Dan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shout it out, Sheriff,&#8221; came the response from
within the darkened room, and the bartender
appeared at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anybody wants me, they may find me at
Brent&#8217;s; I&#8217;m going out that way,&#8221; the sheriff said,
as he loosened the reins. &#8220;Bite, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you,&#8221; he
growled at his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Jim,&#8221; sleepily replied the bartender,
watching the peace officer as he cantered briskly
down the street. He yawned, stretched and returned
to his chair, there to doze lightly as long
as he might.</p>

<p>Shields usually left word at the Oasis as to where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
he might be found in case he should be badly
needed, but in this instance he had left word where
he could not be found if needed. He cantered out
of the town over the trail which led to Brent&#8217;s ranch
and held to it until he had put great enough distance
behind to assure him that he was out of sight
of any curious citizen of Ford&#8217;s Station. Then he
wheeled abruptly as he reached the bottom of an
arroyo and swung sharply to the northeast at a
right angle to his former course and pushed his
mount at a lope around the chaparrals and cacti,
all the time riding more to the east and in the
direction of the U Bend of the Limping Water.
He frowned slightly and grumbled as he estimated
that The Orphan would have nearly three hours&#8217;
start of him by the time he reached his objective,
which meant a long chase in the pursuit of such a
man.</p>

<p>To a tenderfoot the heat would have been very
oppressive, even dangerous, but the sheriff thought
it an ideal temperature for hunting. He smiled
pleasantly at his surroundings and was pleased by
the playful vim of his belligerent pinto, whose
actions were not in the least intended to be playful.
When the animal suddenly turned its head and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
nipped hard and quick at the sheriff&#8217;s legs, getting
a mouthful of nasty leather and seasoned ash for
its reward, he gleefully kicked the pony in the eye
when it let go, and then rowelled a streak of perforations
in its ugly hide with his spurs as an
encouragement. The ensuing bucking was joy to
his heart, and he feared that he might eventually
grow to like the animal.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the U Bend he put in half
an hour burying the human butts of The Orphan&#8217;s
joke, for the perpetrator liked to leave his trophies
where they could be seen and appreciated. Shields
looked sadly at the dead sheep, said &#8220;Hell&#8221; twice
and forded the stream, picked up the outlaw&#8217;s trail
on the further side and cantered along it. The
trail was very plain to him, straight as a chalk line,
and it led toward the northeast, which suited the
sheriff, because there was a goodly sized water
hole twenty miles further on in that direction.
Perhaps he would find The Orphan fortified there,
for it would be just like that person to monopolize
the only drinking water within twenty miles and
force his humorous adversary to either take the
hole or go back to the Limping Water for a drink.
Anyway, The Orphan would get awfully soiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
wallowing about in the mud and water, and he
would not hurt the water much unless he lacked the
decency to bleed on the bank. Having decided to
take the hole in preference to riding back to the
creek, the sheriff immediately dismissed that phase
of the game from his mind and fell to musing
about the rumors which had persistently reiterated
that the Apaches were out.</p>

<p>Practical joking with The Orphan and interfering
with the traveling of Apache war parties
were much the same in results, so the sheriff made
up his mind to attend to the lesser matter, if need
be, after he had quieted the man he was following.
Everybody knew that Apaches were very bad, but
that The Orphan was worse; and, besides, the latter
would be laughing derisively about that matter
concerning a drink. The sheriff grinned and rode
happily forward, taking pains, however, to circle
around all chaparrals and covers of every nature,
for he did not know but that his playful enemy
might have tired of riding before the water hole
had been reached and decided to camp out under
cover. While the sheriff was unafraid, he had
befitting respect for the quality of The Orphan&#8217;s
marksmanship, which was reputed as being above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
reproach; and he was not expected to determine
offhand whether the outlaw was above lying in
ambush. So he used his field glass constantly in
sweeping covers and rode forward toward the
water hole.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>CONCERNING AN ARROW</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE bleak foreground of gray soil, covered
with drifts of alkali and
sand, was studded with clumps of mesquite and cacti and occasional tufts
of sun-burned grass, dusty and somber, while a few sagebrush blended
their leaves to the predominating color. Back of this was a near horizon
to the north and east, brought near by the skyline of a low, undulating
range of sand hills rising from the desert to meet a faded sky. The
morning glow brought this skyline into sharp definition as the dividing
line between the darkness of the plain in the shadow of the range and the
fast increasing morning light. To the south and west the plain blended
into the sky, and there was no horizon.</p>

<p>Two trails met and crossed near a sand-buffeted
bowlder of lava stone, which was huge, grotesque
and forbidding in its bulky indistinctness. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
first of the trails ran north and south and was faint
but plainly discernible, being beaten a trifle below
the level of the desert and forming a depression
which the winds alternately filled and emptied of
dust; and its arrow-like directness, swerving neither
to the right nor left, bespoke of the haste which
urged the unfortunate traveler to have done with
it as speedily as possible, since there was nothing
alluring along its heat-cursed course to bid him
tarry in his riding. There was yet another reason
for haste, for the water holes were over fifty miles
apart, and in that country water holes were more
or less uncertain and doubtful as to being free from
mineral poisons. On the occasions when the
Apaches awoke to find that many of their young
men were missing, and a proved warrior or two,
this trail become weighted with possibilities, for
this desert was the playground of war parties, an
unlimited ante-room for the preliminaries to predatory
pilgrimages; and the northern trail then partook
of the nature of a huge wire over which played
an alternating current, the potentials of which were
the ranges at one end and the savagery and war
spirit of the painted tribes at the other: and the
voltage was frequently deadly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>The other trail, crossing the first at right angles,
led eastward to the fertile valleys of the Canadian
and the Cimarron; westward it spread out like
the sticks of a fan to anywhere and nowhere, gradually
resolving itself into the fainter and still more
faint individual paths which fed it as single strands
feed a rope. It lacked the directness of its intersector
because of the impenetrable chaparrals which
forced it to wander hither and yon. Neither was
it as plain to the eye, for preference, except in cases
of urgent necessity, foreswore its saving of miles
and journeyed by the more circuitous southern trail
which wound beneath cottonwoods and mottes of
live oak and frequently dipped beneath the waters
of sluggish streams, the banks of which were
fringed with willows.</p>

<p>As a lean coyote loped past the point of intersection
a moving object suddenly topped the skyline
of the southern end of the sandhills to the east and
sprang into sharp silhouette, paused for an instant
on the edge of the range and then, plunging down
into the shadows at its base, rode rapidly toward
the bowlder.</p>

<p>He was an Apache, and was magnificent in his
proportions and the easy erectness of his poise. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
glanced sharply about him, letting his gaze finally
settle on the southern trail and then, leaning over,
he placed an object on the highest point of the
rock. Wheeling abruptly, he galloped back over
his trail, the rising wind setting diligently at work
to cover the hoofprints of his pony. He had no
sooner dropped from sight over the hills than
another figure began to be defined in the dim light,
this time from the north.</p>

<p>The newcomer rode at an easy canter and found
small pleasure in the cloud of alkali dust which the
wind kept at pace with him. His hat, the first
visible sign of his calling, proclaimed him to be a
cowboy, and when he had stopped at the bowlder
his every possession endorsed the silent testimony
of the hat.</p>

<p>He was bronzed and self-reliant, some reason
for the latter being suggested by the long-barreled
rifle which swung from his right saddle skirt and
the pair of Colt&#8217;s which lay along his thighs. He
wore the usual blue flannel shirt, open at the throat,
the regular silk kerchief about his neck, and the
indispensable chaps, which were of angora goatskin.
His boots were tight fitting, with high heels,
and huge brass spurs projected therefrom. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
forty-foot coil of rawhide hung from the pommel
of his &#8220;rocking-chair&#8221; saddle and a slicker was
strapped behind the cantle.</p>

<p>He glanced behind him as he drew rein, wondering
when the sheriff would show himself, for he
was being followed, of that he was certain. That
was why he had ridden through so many chaparrals
and doubled on his trail. He was now riding to
describe a circle, the object being to get behind his
pursuer and to do some hunting on his own account.
As he started to continue on his way his quick eyes
espied something on the bowlder which made him
suddenly draw rein again. Glancing to the ground
he saw the tracks made by the Apache, and he
peered intently along the eastern trail with his hand
shading his eyes. The eyes were of a grayish blue,
hard and steely and cruel. They were calculating
eyes, and never missed anything worth seeing. The
fierce glare of the semi-tropical sun which for many
years had daily assaulted them made it imperative
that he squint from half-closed lids, and had given
his face a malevolent look. And the characteristics
promised by the eyes were endorsed by his jaw,
which was square and firm set, underlying thin,
straight lips. But about his lips were graven lines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
so cynical and yet so humorous as to baffle an
observer.</p>

<p>Raising his canteen to his lips he counted seven
swallows and then, letting it fall to his side, he
picked up the object which had made him pause.
There was no surprise in his face, for he never was
surprised at anything.</p>

<p>As he looked at the object he remembered the
rumors of the Apache war dances and of fast-riding,
paint-bedaubed &#8220;hunting parties.&#8221; What
had been rumor he now knew to be a fact, and his
face became even more cruel as he realized that he
was playing tag with the sheriff in the very heart
of the Apache playground, where death might lurk
in any of the thorny covers which surrounded him
on all sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apache war arrow,&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;Now it
shore beats the devil that me and the sheriff can&#8217;t
have a free rein to settle up our accounts. Somebody
is always sticking their nose in my business,&#8221;
he grumbled. Then he frowned at the arrow in
his hand. &#8220;That red on the head is blood,&#8221; he
murmured, noticing the salient points of the
weapon, &#8220;and that yellow hair means good scalping.
The thong of leather spells plunder, and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
was pointing to the east. The buck that brought
it went back again, so this is to show his friends
which way to ride. He was in a hurry, too, judging
from the way he threw sand, and from them
toe-prints.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hated Apaches vindictively, malevolently,
with a single purpose and instinct, because of a
little score he owed them. Once when he had
managed to rustle together a big herd of horses
and was within a day&#8217;s ride of a ready market, a
party of Apaches had ridden up in the night and
made off with not only the stolen animals, but also
with his own horse. This had lost him a neat sum
and had forced him to carry a forty-pound saddle,
a bridle and a rifle for two days under a merciless
sun before he reached civilization. He did not
thank them for not killing him, which they for
some reason neglected to do. Apache stock was
down very low with him, and he now had an opportunity
to even the score. Then he thought of the
sheriff, and swore. Finally he decided that he
would just shoot that worthy as soon as he came
within range, and so be free to play his lone hand
against the race that had stolen his horses. His
eyes twinkled at the game he was about to play,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
and he regarded the silent message and guide with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s all the same to you, I&#8217;ll just polish you
up a bit&#8221;&#8211;and when he replaced it on the bowlder
its former owner would not have known it to
be the same weapon, for its head was not red, but
as bright as the friction of a handful of sand could
make it. This destroyed its message of plentiful
slaughter and, he knew, would grieve his enemies.
He touched it gently with his hand and it swung at
right angles to its former position and now pointed
northward and in the direction from which he
expected the sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d nice of that Apache leaving me
this, but I reckon I&#8217;ll switch them reinforcements&#8211;the
sheriff will be some pleased to meet them,&#8221; he
said, grinning at the novelty of the situation.
&#8220;Nobody will even suspect how a lone puncher&#8221;&#8211;for
he regarded himself as a cowman&#8211;&#8220;squaring
up a couple of scores went and saved the eastern
valleys from more devilment. If the war-whoops
are out along the Cimarron and Canadian they
are shore havin&#8217; fun enough to give me a little.
But I would like to see the sheriff&#8217;s face when he
bumps into the little party I&#8217;m sending his way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
Wonder how many he will get before he goes
under?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he again took up the arrow and carefully
removed the hair and thong of leather, chuckling
at the tale of woe the denuded weapon would tell,
after which he placed it as before, wishing he knew
how to indicate that the Apaches had been wiped
out.</p>

<p>He rode to a chaparral which lay three hundred
yards to the southeast of him and thence around it
to the far side, where he dismounted and fastened
his horse to the empty air by simply allowing the
reins to hang down in front of the animal&#8217;s eyes.
The pony knew many things about ropes and
straps, and what it knew it knew well; nothing
short of dynamite would have moved it while the
reins dangled before its eyes.</p>

<p>Its master slowly returned to the bowlder, where
he set to work to cover his tracks with dust, for
although the shifting sand was doing this for him,
it was not doing it fast enough to suit him. When
he had assured himself that he had performed his
task in a thoroughly workmanlike manner he
returned to his horse, and finally found a snug
place of concealment for it and himself. First
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
bandaging its eyes so that it would not whinny at
the approach of other horses, he searched his pockets
and finally brought to light a pack of greasy
playing cards, with which he amused himself at
solitaire, diligently keeping his eyes on both ends
of the heavier trail.</p>

<p>His intermittent scrutiny was finally rewarded
by a cloud of dust which steadily grew larger on
the southern horizon and soon revealed the character
of the riders who made it. As they drew
nearer to him his implacable hatred caused him to
pick up his rifle, but he let it slide from him as he
counted the number of the approaching party,
before which was being driven a herd of horses
which were intended to be placed as relays for the
main force.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two, five, eight, eleven, sixteen, twenty,
twenty-four, twenty-seven,&#8221; he muttered, carefully
settling himself more comfortably. He could distinguish
the war paint on the reddish-brown colored
bodies, and he smiled at what was in store for
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I won&#8217;t get gay with no twenty-seven
Apaches,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I can wait, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon reaching the rock the leaders of the band
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
glanced at the arrow, excitedly exchanged monosyllables
and set off to the north at a hard gallop,
being followed by the others. As he expected, they
were Apaches, which meant that of all red raiders
they were the most proficient. They were human
hyenas with rare intelligence for war and a most
aggravating way of not being where one would
expect them to be, as army officers will testify.
Besides, an Apache war party did not appear to
have stomachs, and so traveled faster and farther
than the cavalry which so often pursued them.</p>

<p>The watcher chuckled softly at the success of his
stratagem and, suddenly arising, went carefully
around the chaparral until he could see the fast-vanishing
braves. Waiting until they had disappeared
over the northern end of the crescent-shaped
range of hills, he hurried to the bowlder
and again picked up the arrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Didn&#8217;t take it with them, eh?&#8221; he
soliloquized. &#8220;Well, that means that there&#8217;s more
coming, so I&#8217;ll just send the next batch plumb
west&#8211;they&#8217;ll be some pleased to explore this God-forsaken
desert some extensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grinning joyously, he replaced the weapon with
its head pointing westward and then looked anxiously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
at the tracks of the party which had just
passed. Deciding that the wind would effectually
cover them in an hour at most, he returned to his
hiding place, taking care to cover his own tracks.
Taking a chance on the second contingent going
north was all right, but he didn&#8217;t care to run the
risk of having them ride to him for explanations.
Picking up the cards again he shuffled them and
suffered defeat after defeat, and finally announced
his displeasure at the luck he was having.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw nothing like it!&#8221; he grumbled
petulantly. &#8220;Reckon I&#8217;ll hit up the Old Thirteen
a few,&#8221; beginning a new game. He had whiled
away an hour and a half, and as he stretched himself
his uneasy eyes discovered another cloud on
the southern horizon, which was smaller than the
first. He placed the six of hearts on the five of
hearts, ruffled the pack and then put the cards
down and took up his rifle, watching the cloud
closely. He was soon able to count seven warriors
who were driving another &#8220;cavvieyeh&#8221; of horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Only seven!&#8221; he grunted, shifting his
rifle for action. The fighting lust swept over him,
but he choked it down and idly fingered the hammer
of the gun. &#8220;Nope, I reckon not&#8211;seven husky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
Apaches are too much for one man to go out of his
way to fight. Now, if the sheriff was only with
me,&#8221; and he grinned at the humor of it, &#8220;we might
cut loose and heave lead. But since he ain&#8217;t, this
is where I don&#8217;t chip in&#8211;I&#8217;ll wait a while, for
they&#8217;ll shore come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The seven warriors went through almost the
same actions which their predecessors had gone
through and great excitement prevailed among
them. The leaders pointed to the very faint tracks
which led northward and debated vehemently. But
the two small stones which held the arrow securely
in its position against the possibility of the wind
shifting it could not be doubted, and after a few
minutes had passed they rode as bidden, leaving
one of their number on guard at the bowlder. Soon
the other six were lost to sight among the chaparrals
to the west and the guard sat stolidly under
the blazing sun.</p>

<p>The dispatcher noted the position of a shadow
thrown on the sand by a cactus and laughed silently
as he fingered his rifle. He could not think out
the game. Try as he would, he could find no really
good excuse for the placing of the guard, although
many presented themselves, to be finally cast aside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
But the fact was enough, and when the moving
shadow gave assurance that nearly an hour had
passed since the departure of the guard&#8217;s companions,
the man with the grudge cautiously arose on
one knee.</p>

<p>After examining the contents of his rifle, he
brought it slowly to his shoulder. A quick, calculating
glance told him that the range was slightly
over three hundred yards, and he altered the elevation
of the rear sights accordingly. After a pause,
during which he gauged the strength and velocity
of the northern wind, he dropped his cheek against
the walnut stock of the weapon. The echoless
report rang out flatly and a sudden gust of hot
wind whipped the ragged, gray smoke cloud into
the chaparral, where it lay close to the ground and
spread out like a miniature fog. As the smoke
cleared away a second cartridge, inserted deftly
and quickly, sent another cloud of smoke into the
chaparral and the marksman arose to his feet,
mechanically reloading his gun. The second shot
was for the guard&#8217;s horse, for it would be unnecessarily
perilous to risk its rejoining the departed
braves, which it very probably would do if allowed
to escape.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>Dropping his rifle into the hollow of his arm
he walked swiftly toward the fallen Indian, hoping
that there would be no more war parties, for he
had now made signs which the most stupid Apache
could not fail to note and understand. The dead
guard could be hidden, and by the use of his own
horse and rope he could drag the carcass of the
animal into the chaparral and out of sight. But
the trail which would be left in the loose sand
would be too deep and wide to be covered. He
had crossed the Rubicon, and must stand or fall
by the step.</p>

<p>The Indian had fallen forward against the bowlder
and had slid down its side, landing on his head
and shoulders, in which grotesque position the rock
supported him. One glance assured the &#8220;cowman&#8221;
that his aim had been good, and another
told him that he had to fear the arrival of no more
war parties, for the arrow was gone. He was not
satisfied, however, until he had made a good search
for it, thinking that it might have been displaced
by the fall of the Apache. He lifted the body of
the dead warrior in his arms and flung it across the
apex of the bowlder, face up and balanced nicely,
the head pointing to the north. Then he looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
for the arrow on the sand where the body had
rested, but it was not to be found. A sardonic grin
flitted across his face as he secured the weapons of
the late guard, which were a heavy Colt&#8217;s revolver
and a late pattern Winchester repeater. Taking
the cartridges from his body, he stood up triumphant.
He now had what he needed to meet the
smaller body of Indians on their return, ten shots
in one rifle and a spare Colt&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;One for my cavvieyeh!&#8221; he muttered savagely
as he thought of the loss of his horse herd.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be more, too, before I get through, or
my name&#8217;s not&#8221;&#8211; he paused abruptly, hearing
hoofbeats made by a galloping horse over a stretch
of hard soil which lay to the east of him. Leaping
quickly behind the bowlder, he leveled his own
rifle across the body of the guard and peered intently
toward the east, wondering if the advancing
horseman would be the sheriff or another Apache.
The hoofbeats came rapidly nearer and another
courier turned the corner of the chaparral and
went no further. Again a second shot took care
of the horse and the marksman strode to his second
victim, from whose body and horse he took another
Winchester and Colt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;Now I am in for it!&#8221; he muttered as he looked
down at the warrior. &#8220;This is shore getting warm
and it&#8217;ll be a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n sight warmer if his friends get
anxious about him and hunt him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glancing around the horizon and seeing no signs
of an interruption, he slung the body across his
shoulders and staggered with it to the bowlder,
where he heaved and pushed it across the body of
the first Apache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might as well make a good showing and make
them mad, for I can&#8217;t very well hide you and the
cayuses&#8211;I ain&#8217;t no graveyard,&#8221; he said, stepping
back to look at his work. He felt no remorse, for
that was a sensation not yet awakened in his consciousness.
He was elated at his success, joyous in
catering to his love for fighting, for he would
rather die fighting than live the round of years
heavily monotonous with peace, and his only regret
was having won by ambush. But in this, he told
himself, there was need, for his hatred ordered him
to kill as many as he could, and in any way possible.
Knowing that he was, single-handed, attempting
to outwit wily chiefs and that he had before him a
carnival of fighting, he would not have hesitated
to make use of traps if they were at hand and could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
be used. Perhaps it was old Geronimo whose plans
he was defeating and, if so, no precautions nor
means were unjustifiable and too mean to make
use of, for Geronimo was half-brother to the devil
and a genius for warfare and slaughter, with a
ferocity and cruelty cold-blooded and consummate.</p>

<p>He had yet time to escape from his perilous position
and meet the sheriff, if that worthy had eluded
the first war party. But his elation had the upper
hand and his brute courage was now blind to caution.
He savagely decided that his matter with
the sheriff could wait and that he would take care
of the war parties first, since there was more honor
in fighting against odds. The two Winchesters
and his own Sharps, not to consider the four Colt&#8217;s,
gave him many shots without having to waste time
in reloading, and he drew assurance from the past
that he placed his shots quickly and with precision.
He could put up a magnificent fight in the chaparral,
shifting his position after each shot, and he
could hug the ground where the trunks of the vegetation
were thickest and would prove an effective
barrier against random shots. His wits were keen,
his legs nimble, his eyesight and accuracy above
doubt, and he had no cause to believe that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
strategy was inferior to that of his foes. There
would be no moon for two nights, and he could
escape in the darkness if hunger and thirst should
drive him out. Here he had struck, and here he
would strike again and again, and, if he fell, he
would leave behind him such a tale of fighting as
had seldom been known before; and it pleased his
vanity to think of the amazement the story would
call forth as it was recounted around the campfires
and across the bars of a country larger than
Europe. He did not realize that such a tale would
die if he died and would never be known. His was
the joy of a master of the game, a virile, fearless
fighting machine, a man who had never failed in
the playing of the many hands he had held in desperate
games with death. He was not going to
die; he was going to win and leave dying for others.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SHERIFF FINDS THE ORPHAN</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE day dragged wearily along for the man in the chaparral, and when the
sun showed that it was still two hours from the meridian
he leaped to his feet, rifle in hand, and peered
intently to the west, where he had seen a fast-riding
horseman flit between two chaparrals which
stood far down on the western end of the Cimarron
Trail. Without pausing, he made his way out of
cover and ran rapidly along the edge of the thicket
until he had gained its northwestern extremity,
where he plunged into it, unmindful of the cuts and
slashes from the interlocked thorns. Using the
rifle as a club, he hammered and pushed until he
was screened from the view of any one passing
along the trail, but where he could see all who
approached. As he turned and faced the west he
saw the horseman suddenly emerge from the shelter
of the last chaparral in his course and ride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
straight for the intersection of the trails, his horse
flattened to the earth by the speed it was making.
Waiting until the rider was within fifty yards of
him, he pushed his way out to the trail, the rifle
leaping to his shoulder as he stepped into the open.
The newcomer was looking back at half a dozen
Apaches who had burst into view by the chaparral
he had just quitted, and when he turned he was
stopped by a hail and the sight of an unwavering
rifle held by the man on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;A truce!&#8221; shouted The Orphan from behind
the sights, having an idea and wishing to share it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell, yes!&#8221; cried the astonished sheriff in
reply, slowing down and mechanically following
the already running outlaw to the place where the
latter had spent the last few hours.</p>

<p>By keeping close to the edge of the chaparral,
which receded from the trail, The Orphan had not
been seen by the Apaches, and as he turned into his
hiding place a yell reached his ears. His trophies
on the bowlder were not to be unmourned.</p>

<p>As he wormed his way into the thicket, closely
followed by the sheriff, he tersely explained the
situation, and Shields, feeling somewhat under
obligation to the man who had refrained from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
killing him, nodded and smiled in good nature.
The sheriff thought it was a fine joke and enthusiastically
slapped his enemy on the back to show his
appreciation, for the time forgetting that they very
probably would try to kill each other later on, after
the Apaches had been taken care of.</p>

<p>As they reached a point which gave them a clear
view of the bowlder, The Orphan kicked his companion
on the shin, pointing to the Apaches
grouped around their dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little over three hundred, Sheriff,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You shoot first and I&#8217;ll follow you, so
they&#8217;ll think you shot twice&#8211;there&#8217;s no use letting
them think that there&#8217;s two of us, that is, not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; replied the sheriff, nodding and
throwing his rifle to his shoulder. &#8220;Right end for
me,&#8221; he said, calling his shot so as to be sure that
the same brave would not receive all the attention.
As he fired his companion covered the second warrior,
using one of his captured Winchesters, and
a second later the rifle spun flame. Both warriors
dropped and the remaining four hastily postponed
their mourning and tumbled helter skelter behind
the bowlder, the sheriff&#8217;s second shot becoming a
part of the last one to find cover.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; exulted the sheriff, delighted at the
score. &#8220;Best game I ever took a hand in, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>-d
if it ain&#8217;t! We&#8217;ll have them guessing so hard that
they&#8217;ll get brain fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three shots in as many seconds will make
them think that they are facing a Winchester in
the hands of a crack shot,&#8221; remarked The Orphan,
smiling with pleasure at the sheriff&#8217;s appreciation.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll think that if they can back off from the
bowlder and keep it between them and you that
they can get out of range in a few hundred yards
more. That is where I come in again. You sling
a little lead to let them know that you haven&#8217;t
moved a whole lot, but stop in a couple of minutes,
while I go down the line a ways. The chaparral
sweeps to the north quite a little, and mebby I can
drop a slug behind their fort from down there.
That&#8217;ll make them think you are a jack rabbit at
covering ground and will bother them. If they
rush, which they won&#8217;t after tasting that kind of
shooting, you whistle good and loud and we&#8217;ll make
them plumb disgusted. I&#8217;ll take a Winchester
along with me, so they won&#8217;t have any cause to
suspect that you are an arsenal. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff glanced up as his companion departed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
and was pleased at the outlaw&#8217;s command of the situation.
He had a good chance to wipe out the man,
but that he would not do, for The Orphan trusted
him, and Shields was one who respected a thing
like that.</p>

<p>The outlaw finally stopped about a hundred
yards down the trail and looked out, using his
glasses. A brown shoulder showed under the overhanging
side of the bowlder and he smiled, readjusting
the sights on the Winchester as he waited.
Soon the shoulder raised from the ground and
pushed out farther into sight. Then a poll of
black hair showed itself and slowly raised. The
Orphan took deliberate aim and pulled the trigger.
The head dropped to the sand and the shoulder
heaved convulsively once or twice and then lay
quiet. Leaping up, the marksman hastened back
to the side of the sheriff, who did not trouble himself
to look up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got him, Sheriff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Work up to
the other end and I&#8217;ll go back to where I came
from. They have got all the fighting they have
any use for and will be backing away purty soon
now. The range from the point where I held you
is some closer than it is from here, so you ought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
to get in a shot when they get far enough
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; pleasantly responded Shields, vigorously
attacking the thorns as he began his journey
to the western end of the thicket. &#8220;Ouch!&#8221;
he exclaimed as he felt the pricks. Then he
stopped and slowly turned and saw The Orphan
smiling at him, and grinned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he began, &#8220;why can&#8217;t I go around?&#8221; he
asked, indicating with a sweep of his arm the
southern edge of the chaparral, and intimating that
it would be far more pleasant to skirt the thorns
than to buck against them. &#8220;These d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;</span>d thorns
ain&#8217;t no joke!&#8221; he added emphatically.</p>

<p>The outlaw&#8217;s smile enlarged and he glanced
quickly at the bowlder to see that all was as it
should be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go around in one day afoot,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;By that time they&#8221;&#8211;pointing to the
Apaches&#8211;&#8220;will have made a day&#8217;s journey on
cayuses. And we simply mustn&#8217;t let them get the
best of us that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields grinned and turned half-way around
again: &#8220;It&#8217;s a whole lot dry out here,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and my canteen is on my cayuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, pardner,&#8221; replied The Orphan, holding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
out his canteen and watching the effect of the familiarity.
&#8220;Seven swallows is the dose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff faced him, took the vessel, counted
seven swallows and returned it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m some moist now,&#8221; he remarked, as he
returned to the thorns. &#8220;It&#8217;s too d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;</span>n bad
you&#8217;re bad,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;You&#8217;d make a blamed
good cow-puncher.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan, still smiling, placed his hands on
hips and watched the rapidly disappearing arm of
the law.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right&#8211;too bad he&#8217;ll make me shoot
him,&#8221; he soliloquized, turning toward his post. As
he crawled through a particularly badly matted bit
of chaparral he stopped to release himself and
laughed outright. &#8220;How in thunder did he get so
far west? My trail was as plain as day, too.&#8221;
When he had reached his destination and had settled
down to watch the bowlder he laughed again
and muttered: &#8220;Mebby he figured it out that I was
doubling back and was laying for me to show up.
And that&#8217;s just the way I would have gone, too.
He ain&#8217;t any fool, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought of the sheriff at the far end of the
chaparral and of the repeater he carried, and an
inexplicable impulse of generosity surged over him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
The sheriff would be pleased to do the rest himself,
he thought, and the thought was father to the act.
He picked up the Winchester he had brought with
him and fired at the bowlder, only wishing to let
the Apaches know his position so that they would
think the way clear to the northwest, and so innocently
give the sheriff a shot at them as they
retreated. Dropping the Winchester he took up
his Sharps, his pet rifle, with which he had done
wonderful shooting, and arose to one knee, supporting
his left elbow on the other; between the fingers
of his left hand he held a cartridge in order that
no time should be lost in reloading. The range
was now five hundred yards, and when The Orphan
knew the exact range he swore with rage if he
missed.</p>

<p>His shot had the effect he hoped it would have,
for suddenly there was movement behind the
bowlder. A pony&#8217;s hip showed for an instant and
then leaped from sight as the outlaw reloaded. A
cloud of dust arose to the northwest of and behind
the bowlder, and a series of close reports sounded
from the direction of the sheriff. The Orphan
leaped to his feet and dashed out on the plain to
where his sight would not be obstructed and saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
an Apache, who hung down on the far side of his
horse, sweep northward and gallop along the northern
trail. He fired, but the range was too great,
and the warrior soon dropped from sight over the
range of hills. As The Orphan made his way
toward the bowlder the sheriff emerged from his
shelter and pointed to the west. A pony lay on
its side and not far away was the huddled body of
its rider.</p>

<p>As they neared each other the outlaw noticed
something peculiar about the sheriff&#8217;s ear, and his
look of inquiry was rewarded. &#8220;Stung,&#8221; remarked
Shields, grinning apologetically. &#8220;Just as I shot,&#8221;
he added in explanation of the Apache&#8217;s escape.
&#8220;Wonder what my wife&#8217;ll say?&#8221; he mused, nursing
the swelling.</p>

<p>The Orphan&#8217;s eyes opened a trifle at the sheriff&#8217;s
last words, and he thought of the war party he had
sent north. His decision was immediate: no married
man had any business to run risks, and he was
glad that he refrained from shooting on sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheriff, you vamoose. Clear out now, while
you have the chance. Ride west for an hour, and
then strike north for Ford&#8217;s Station. That buck
that got away is due to run into twenty-seven of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
his friends and relatives that I sent north to meet
you. And they won&#8217;t waste any time in getting
back, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields felt of his ear and laughed softly. He
had a sudden, strong liking for his humorous,
clever enemy, for he recognized qualities which he
had always held in high esteem. While he had
waited in the chaparral for the Apaches to break
cover he had wondered if the Indians which The
Orphan had sent north had been sent for the purpose
of meeting him, and now he had the answer.
Instead of embittering him against his companion,
it increased his respect for that individual&#8217;s strategy,
and he felt only admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw your reception committee in time to
duck,&#8221; the sheriff said, laughing. &#8220;If they kept on
going as they were when I saw them they must
have crossed my trail about three hours later.
When they hit that it is a safe bet that at least some
of them took it up. So if it&#8217;s all the same to you,
I&#8217;ll leave both the north and the west alone and
take another route home. I have shot up all the
war-whoops I care about, so I am well satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suddenly reached down toward his belt, and
then looked squarely into The Orphan&#8217;s gun, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
rested easily on that person&#8217;s hip. His hand kept
on, however, but more slowly and with but two
fingers extended, and disappeared into his chap&#8217;s
pocket, from which it slowly and gingerly brought
forth a package of tobacco and some rice paper.
The Orphan looked embarrassed for a second and
then laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a square man, Sheriff, but I wasn&#8217;t
sure,&#8221; he said in apology. &#8220;So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; cried the sheriff heartily.
&#8220;I was a big fool to make a play like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan smiled and turned squarely around
and walked away in the direction of his horse.
Shields stared at his back and then rolled a cigarette
and grinned: &#8220;By George!&#8221; he ejaculated at
the confidence displayed by his companion, and he
slowly followed.</p>

<p>After they had mounted in silence the sheriff suddenly
turned and looked his companion squarely in
the eyes and received a steady, frank look in return.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil made you ventilate them sheep
herders that way?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;And go and drive
all of them sheep over the bank?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan frowned momentarily, but answered
without reserve.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>&#8220;Those sheep herders reckoned they&#8217;d get a
reputation!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;And they would have
gotten it, too, only I beat them on the draw. As
for the idiotic muttons, they went plumb loco at
the shooting and pushed each other over the bank.
To hell with the herders&#8211;they only got what they
was trying to hand me. But I&#8217;m a whole lot sorry
about the sheep, although I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m dead stuck
on range-killers of any kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff reflectively eyed his companion&#8217;s gun
and remembered its celerity into getting into action,
which persuaded him that The Orphan was telling
the truth, and swept aside the last chance for fair
warfare between the two for the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is too bad, all them innocent sheep
drowned that way,&#8221; he slowly replied. &#8220;But they
are shore awful skittish at times. Well, do we
part?&#8221; he asked, suddenly holding out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we do, Sheriff, and I&#8217;m blamed glad
to have met you,&#8221; replied the outlaw as he shook
hands with no uncertain grip. &#8220;Keep away from
them Apaches, and so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, I will,&#8221; responded the arm of the
law. &#8220;And I&#8217;m glad to have met you, too. So
long!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SECOND OFFENSE</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>B</span>ILL HOWLAND emerged from the six-by-six office of the F. S. and S. Stage
Company and strolled down the street to where his
Concord stood. He hitched up and, after examining
the harness, gained his seat, gathered up the
lines and yelled. There was a lurch and a rumble,
and Bill turned the corner on two wheels to the
gratification of sundry stray dogs, whose gratification
turned to yelps of surprise and pain as the
driver neatly flecked bits of hair from their bodies
with his sixteen foot &#8220;blacksnake.&#8221; Twice each
week Bill drove his Concord around the same corner
on the same two wheels and flecked bits of hair
from stray dogs with the same whip. He would
have been deeply grieved if the supply of new stray
dogs gave out, for no dogs were ever known to get
close enough to be skinned the second time; once
was enough, and those which had felt the sting of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
Bill&#8217;s leather were content to stand across the street
and create the necessary excitement to urge the new
arrivals forward. The local wit is reported as
saying: &#8220;Dogs may come and dogs may go, but
Bill goes on forever,&#8221; which saying pleased Bill
greatly.</p>

<p>As he threw the mail bag on the seat the sheriff
came up and watched him, his eyes a-twinkle with
humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sheriff, how&#8217;s the boy?&#8221; genially asked
Bill, who could talk all day on anything and two
days on nothing without fatigue.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Bill, thank you,&#8221; the sheriff replied.
&#8220;I hope you are able to take something more than
liquid nourishment,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you trust me for that, Sheriff. When my
appetite gives out I&#8217;ll be ready to plant. I see your
ear is some smaller. Blamed funny how they do
swell sometimes,&#8221; remarked the driver, loosening
his collar.</p>

<p>The sheriff knew what that action meant and hurried
to break the thread of the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;New wheel?&#8221; he asked, eying what he knew to
be old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope, painted, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; the driver replied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
grinning. &#8220;But she shore does look new, don&#8217;t
she? You see, Dick put in two new spokes yesterday,
and when I saw &#8217;em I says, says I, &#8216;Dick,
that new wheel don&#8217;t look good thataway,&#8217; says I.
&#8216;It&#8217;ll look like a limp, them new spokes coming
&#8217;round all alone like,&#8217; says I. So we paints it, but
we didn&#8217;t have time to paint the others, but they
won&#8217;t make much difference, anyhow. Funny how
a little paint will change things, now ain&#8217;t it?
Why, I can remember when<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>-&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much mail nowadays?&#8221; interposed the sheriff
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. Folks out here ain&#8217;t a-helpin&#8217; Uncle
Sam much. Postmaster says he only sold ten
stamps this week. What he wants, as I told him,
is women. Then everybody&#8217;ll be sendin&#8217; letters and
presents and things. Now, I knows what I&#8217;m
talking about, because<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>-&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Apaches are out,&#8221; jabbed the sheriff, hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard that you had a soiree with them.
But they won&#8217;t get so far north as this. No, siree,
they won&#8217;t. They knows too much, Apaches do.
Ain&#8217;t they smart cusses, though? Now, there&#8217;s old
Geronimo&#8211;been raising the devil for years. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
cavalry goes out for him regular, and shore thinks
he&#8217;s caught, but he ain&#8217;t. When he&#8217;s found he&#8217;s
home smoking his pipe and counting his wives,
which are shore numerous, they say. Now, I&#8217;ve
got a bully scheme for getting him, Sheriff<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you,&#8221; came from the office. &#8220;Do you
reckon that train is going to tie up and wait for you,
hey? Do you think you are so d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d important
that they won&#8217;t pull out unless you&#8217;re on hand?
Why in h&#8211;l don&#8217;t you quit chinning and get
started?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you choke up!&#8221; cried Bill, clambering up
to his seat. &#8220;Who&#8217;s running this, anyhow!&#8221; he
grumbled under his breath. Then he took up the
reins and carefully sorted them, after which he
looked down at Shields, whose face wore a smile
of amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill Howland ain&#8217;t none a-scared because a lot
of calamity howlers get a hunch. Not on your life!
I&#8217;ve reached the high C of rollicking progress too
many times to be airy scairt at rumors. Show me
the feather-dusters in war paint, and then I&#8217;ll take
some stock in raids. You get up a bet on me
Sheriff, make a little easy money. Back Bill Howland
to be right here in seventy-two hours, right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
side up and smiling, and you&#8217;ll win. You just bet
you&#8217;ll<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t get here in a year unless you
starts, you pest! For God&#8217;s sake get a-going and
give the sheriff a rest!&#8221; came explosively from the
office, accompanied by a sound as if a chair had
dropped to its four legs. A tall, angular man stood
in the doorway and shook his fist at the huge cloud
of dust which rolled down the street, muttering
savagely. Bill Howland had started on his eighty-mile
trip to Sagetown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damnedest talker on two laigs,&#8221; asserted the
clerk. &#8220;He&#8217;ll drive me loco some day with his
eternal jabber, jabber. Why do you waste time
with him? Tell him to close his yap and go to
h&#8211;l. Beat him over the head, anything to shut
him up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields smiled: &#8220;Oh, he can&#8217;t help it. He don&#8217;t
do anybody any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk shook his head in doubt and started to
return to his chair, and then stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you expect some women out purty soon,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Sisters and a friend,&#8221; Shields replied
shortly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you a little leary about letting &#8217;em come
out here while the Apaches are out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very much&#8211;I&#8217;ll be on hand when they
arrive,&#8221; the sheriff assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How soon are they due to land?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next trip if nothing hinders them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Hawes is comin&#8217; out next trip,&#8221; volunteered
the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; responded the sheriff, turning to go.
&#8220;Every gun counts, and Jim is a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; the agent was lonesome, &#8220;I heard down
at the Oasis last night that The Orphant was seen
out near the Cross Bar-8 yesterday. He ought to
get shot, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n him! But that&#8217;s a purty big contract,
I reckon. They say he can shoot like the
very devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re right, he can,&#8221; Shields replied.
&#8220;Everybody knows that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charley seems to be in a hurry,&#8221; remarked the
agent, looking down the street at a cowboy, a friend
of the sheriff, who was coming at a dead gallop.
The sheriff looked and Charley waved his arm. As
he came within hailing distance he shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Orphan killed Jimmy Ford this morning
on Twenty Mile Trail! His pardner got away by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
shootin&#8217; The Orphan&#8217;s horse and taking to the trail
through Little Arroyo. But he&#8217;s shot, just the
same, &#8217;though not bad. The rest of the Cross
Bar-8 outfit are going out for him; they&#8217;ve been
out, but they can&#8217;t follow his trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; cried the sheriff, running toward his
corral. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; he shouted over his shoulder as
he turned the corner. In less than five minutes he
was back again, and on his best horse, and following
the impatient cowboy, swung down the street
at a gallop in the direction of Twenty Mile Trail.</p>

<p>As they left the town behind and swung through
the arroyo leading to the Limping Water, through
which the stage route lay, Charley began to speak
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jimmy and Pete Carson were taking a rest in
the shade of the chaparral and playin&#8217; old sledge,
when they looked up and saw The Orphan looking
down at them. They&#8217;re rather easy-going, and so
they asked him to take a hand. He said he would,
and got off his cayuse and sat down with them.
Jimmy started a new deal, but The Orphan objected
to old sledge and wanted poker, at the same time
throwing a bag of dust down in front of him.
Jimmy looked at Pete, who nodded, and put his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
wealth in front of him. Well, they played along
for a while, and The Orphan began to have great
luck. When he had won five straight jack pots it
was more than Jimmy could stand, him being young
and hasty. He saw his new Cheyenne saddle, what
he was going to buy, getting further away all the
time, and he yelled &#8216;Cheat!&#8217; grabbing for his gun,
what was plumb crazy for him to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Orphan fired from his hip quick as a wink,
and Jimmy fell back just as Pete drew. The
Orphan swung on him and ordered him to drop his
gun, which same Pete did, being sick at the stomach
at Jimmy&#8217;s passing. Then The Orphan told him
to take his dirty money and his cheap life and go
back to his mamma. Pete didn&#8217;t stop none to argue,
but mounted and rode away. But the fool wasn&#8217;t
satisfied at having a whole skin after a run-in with
The Orphan, and when he got off about four hundred
yards and right on the edge of Little Arroyo,
where he could get cover in one jump, he up and let
drive, killing The Orphan&#8217;s horse. Pete got two
holes in his shoulder before he could get out of
sight, and he remembered that his shot had hardly
left his gun before he had &#8217;em, too. Pete says he
wonders how in h&#8211;l The Orphan could shoot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
twice so quick, when his gun&#8217;s a Sharp&#8217;s single
shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields was pleased with the knowledge that it
was not a plain murder this time, and fell to wondering
if the other killings in which The Orphan
had figured had not in a measure been justified.
Hearsay cried &#8220;Murderer,&#8221; but his own personal
experience denied the term. Did not The Orphan
know that Shields was after him, and that the
sheriff was no man to be taken lightly when he
had shown mercy near the big bowlder? The outlaw
must be fair and square, reasoned the sheriff,
else he would not have looked for those qualities
in another, and least of all in an enemy. The outlaw
had given him plenty of chances to kill and had
thought nothing of it, time and time again turning
his back without hesitation. True, The Orphan had
covered him when his hand had streaked for his
tobacco; but the sheriff would have done the same,
because the movement was decidedly hostile, and he
had been fortunate in not having paid dearly for
his rash action. The Orphan had taken a chance
when he refrained from pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>Charley continued: &#8220;Jimmy&#8217;s outfit swear they&#8217;ll
have a lynchin&#8217; bee to square things for the Kid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
They are plumb crazy about it. Jimmy was a whole
lot liked by them, and the foreman is going to give
them a week off with no questions asked. They
are getting things ready now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff turned to his companion, his hazel
eyes aflame with anger at this threat of lynching
when he had given plain warning that such lawlessness
would not for one minute be tolerated by
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll call on the Cross Bar-8 first, Charley,
and find out when this lynching bee is due to come
off,&#8221; he said, turning toward the northwest. Charley
looked surprised at the sudden change in the
plans, but followed without comment, secretly glad
that trouble was in store for the ranch he had no
use for.</p>

<p>After an hour of fast riding they rode up to the
corral of the Cross Bar-8, and Shields, seeing a
cowboy busily engaged in cleaning a rifle, asked for
Sneed, at the same time making a mental note of
the preparations which were going on about him.</p>

<p>The foreman, as if in answer to the sheriff&#8217;s
words, walked into sight around the corral wall
and stepped forward eagerly when he saw who the
caller was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>&#8220;I see that you know all about it, Sheriff,&#8221; he
began, hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just told the boys that they
can go out for him,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting
ready now, and will soon be on his trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; coldly inquired the sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get him if you don&#8217;t,&#8221; assured the foreman,
who had about as much tact as a mule.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot the first man who tries it,&#8221; the sheriff
said, as he flecked a bit of dust from his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Sneed in astonishment. &#8220;By
God, Sheriff, that&#8217;s a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d hard assertion to
make!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hold <i>you</i> responsible,&#8221; continued the
sheriff, leaning forward as if to give weight to his
words.</p>

<p>The cowboy stopped cleaning his rifle and stood
up, covering the sheriff, a sneer on his face and
anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a-scared, we ain&#8217;t, by God!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;The Orphan has got away too many times
already, and here is where he gets stopped for good!
When we gets through with him he won&#8217;t shoot no
more friends of ourn, nor nobody else&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields looked him squarely in the eyes: &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t drop that gun I&#8217;ll drop you, Bucknell,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
said pleasantly, and his eyes proclaimed that he
meant what he said.</p>

<p>Sneed sprang forward and knocked the gun aside;
&#8220;You d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n fool!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You ornery,
silly fool! Get back to the bunk house or I&#8217;ll make
you wish you had never seen that gun! Go on, get
the h&#8211;l out of here before you join Jimmy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the foreman turned to Shields, feeling that
he had lost much through the rashness of his man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pay any attention to that crazy yearling,
Sheriff,&#8221; he said earnestly. &#8220;He&#8217;s only feeling his
oats. But we only wanted to round him up,&#8221; he
continued on the main topic. &#8220;We meant to turn
him over to you after we&#8217;d got him. He&#8217;s a
blasted, thieving, murdering dog, that&#8217;s what he is,
and he oughtn&#8217;t get away this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep out of this, and keep your men out
of it, too,&#8221; responded Shields, turning away. &#8220;I
mean what I say. Jimmy started the mess and got
the worst of it. I&#8217;ll get The Orphan, or nobody
will. As long as I&#8217;m sheriff of this county I&#8217;ll take
care of my job without any lynching parties. Come
on, Charley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deputize some of my boys, Sheriff!&#8221; he begged.
&#8220;Let &#8217;em think they&#8217;re doing something. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
Orphan is a bad man to go after alone. The boys
are so mad that they&#8217;ll get him if they have to ride
through hell after him. Swear them in and let
them get him lawfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; retorted Shields cynically. &#8220;And have
to shoot them to keep them from shooting him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, Sheriff,&#8221; cried Sneed, losing control
of his temper, &#8220;this is our fight, and we&#8217;re going to
see it through! We&#8217;ll get that cur, sheriff or no
sheriff, and when we do, he&#8217;ll stretch rope! And
anybody who tries to stop us will get hurt! I
ain&#8217;t making any threats, Sheriff; only telling plain
facts, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be a wreck,&#8221; responded Shields, still
smiling. &#8220;For I&#8217;ll stop it, even if I have to shoot
you first, which are also plain facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed&#8217;s men had been coming up while they
talked and were freely voicing their opinions of
sheriffs. Sneed stepped close to the peace officer
and laughed, his face flushed with foolish elation
at his strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see &#8217;em?&#8221; he asked, ironically, indicating
his men by a sweep of his arm. &#8220;Do you
think you could shoot me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The reply was instantaneous. The last word
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
had hardly left his lips before he peered blankly
into the cold, unreasoning muzzle of a Colt, and
the sheriff&#8217;s voice softly laughed up above him.
The cowboys stood as if turned to stone, not daring
to risk their foreman&#8217;s life by a move, for they did
not understand the sheriff&#8217;s methods of arguments,
never having become thoroughly acquainted with
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know me better now, Sneed,&#8221; Shields
remarked quietly as he slipped his Colt into its
holster. &#8220;I&#8217;m running the law end of the game
and I&#8217;ll keep right on running it as I d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d please
while I&#8217;m called sheriff, understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed was a brave man, and he thoroughly appreciated
the clean-cut courage which had directed
the sheriff&#8217;s act, and he knew, then, that Shields
would keep his word. He involuntarily stepped
back and intently regarded the face above him,
seeing a not unpleasant countenance, although it
was tanned by the suns and beaten by the weather
of fifty years. The hazel eyes twinkled and the thin
lips twitched in that quiet humor for which the man
was famed; yet underlying the humor was stern,
unyielding determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shore nervy, Sheriff,&#8221; at length remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
the foreman. &#8220;The boys are loco, but I&#8217;ll
try to hold them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll hold them, or bury them,&#8221; responded
the sheriff, and turning to his companion he said:
&#8220;Now I&#8217;m with you, Charley. So long, Sneed,&#8221;
he pleasantly called over his shoulder as if there
had been no unpleasant disagreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, Sheriff,&#8221; replied the foreman, looking
after the departing pair and hardly free from his
astonishment. Then he turned to his men: &#8220;You
heard what he said, and you saw what he did.
You keep out of this, or I&#8217;ll make you d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d
sorry, if he don&#8217;t. If The Orphan comes your way,
all right and good. But you let his trail religiously
alone, do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>BILL JUSTIFIES HIS CREATION</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>B</span>ILL HOWLAND careened along the stage route, rapidly leaving Ford&#8217;s
Station in his rear. He rolled through the arroyo on
alternate pairs of wheels, splashed through the
Limping Water, leaving it roiled and muddy, and
shot up the opposite bank with a rush. Before him
was a stretch of a dozen miles, level as a billiard
table, and then the route traversed a country rocky
and uneven and wound through cuts and defiles and
around rocky buttes of strange formation. This
continued for ten miles, and the last defile cut
through a ridge of rock, called the Backbone, which
ranged in height from twenty to forty feet, smooth,
unbroken and perpendicular on its eastern face.
This ridge wound and twisted from the big chaparral
twenty miles below the defile to a branch of the
Limping Water, fifteen miles above. And in all
the thirty-five miles there was but a single opening,
the one used by Bill and the stage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>In crossing the level plain Bill could see for miles
to either side of him, but when once in the rough
country his view was restricted to yards, and more
often to feet. It was here that he expected trouble
if at all, and he usually went through it with a
speed which was reckless, to say the least.</p>

<p>He had just dismissed the possibility of meeting
with Apaches as he turned into the last long defile,
which he was pleased to call a cañon. As he made
the first turn he nearly fell from his seat in astonishment
at what he saw. Squarely in the center of
the trail ahead of him was a horseman, who rode
the horse which had formerly belonged to Jimmy
of the Cross Bar-8, and across the cut lay a heavy
piece of timber, one of the dead trees which were
found occasionally at that altitude, and it effectively
barred the passing of the stage. The horseman
wore his sombrero far back on his head and a rifle
lay across his saddle, while two repeating Winchesters
were slung on either side of his horse. One
startled look revealed the worst to the driver&#8211;The
Orphan, the terrible Orphan faced him!</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t choke&#8211;I&#8217;m not going to eat you,&#8221;
assured the horseman with a smile. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
going to smoke half of your tobacco&#8211;and you can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
bring me a half pound when you come back from
Sagetown. Just throw it up yonder,&#8221; pointing to
a rocky ledge, &#8220;and keep going right ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill looked very much relieved, and hastily fumbled
in his hip pocket, which was a most suicidal
thing to do in a hurry; but The Orphan didn&#8217;t even
move at the play, having judged the man before
him and having faith in his judgment. The hand
came out again with a pouch of tobacco, which its
owner flung to the outlaw. After putting half of
it in his own pouch and enclosing a coin to pay for
his half pound, The Orphan tossed it back again
and then moved the tree trunk until it fell to the
road, when he dismounted and rolled it aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget right now that you have seen me or
you&#8217;ll have heart disease some day in this place,&#8221;
warned the horseman, moving aside. Bill swore
earnestly that at times his memory was too short
to even remember his own name, and he enthusiastically
lashed his cayuse sextet. As he swung out
on the plain again he glanced furtively over his
shoulder and breathed a deep breath of relief when
he found that the outlaw was not in sight. He
then tied a knot in his handkerchief so as to be
sure to remember to get a half-pound package of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
tobacco. A new responsibility, and one which he
had never borne before, weighed upon him. He
must keep silent&#8211;and what a rich subject for endless
conversations! Talking material which would
last him for years must be sealed tightly within his
memory on penalty of death if he failed to keep it
secret.</p>

<p>After an uneventful trip across the open plain,
which passed so rapidly because of his intent
thoughts that he hardly realized it, he ripped into
Sagetown with a burst of speed and flung the mail
bag at the station agent, after which he hastened to
float the dust down his throat.</p>

<p>When he met his Sagetown friends he had fairly
to choke down his secret, and his aching desire to
create a sensation pained and worried him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made her faster than usual, Bill,&#8221; remarked
the bartender casually. &#8220;Yore half-an-hour
ahead of time,&#8221; he added in a congratulatory
tone as he placed a bottle and glass before the new
arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I had to stop, too,&#8221; Bill replied, and
then hastily gulped down his liquor to save himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; asked old Pop Westley, an habitué
of the saloon. Pop Westley had fought through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
the Civil War and never forgot to tell of his experiences,
which must have been unusually numerous,
even for four years of hard campaigning, if one
may judge from the fact that he never had to repeat,
and yet used them as his <i>coup d&#8217;état</i> in many conversational
bouts. &#8220;What was it, Injuns?&#8221; he
asked, winking at the bartender as if in prophecy
as to what the driver would choose for his next lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied Bill, groping for an idea to
get him out of trouble. &#8220;Nope, just had to lose
twenty minutes rollin&#8217; rocks out of the cañon&#8211;they
must have been a little landslide since I went
through her the last time. Some of &#8217;em was purty
big, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might a had to kill some Injuns,
like you did when they broke out four years ago,&#8221;
responded the bartender gravely. &#8220;Tell us about
that time you licked them dozen mad Apache warriors,
Bill,&#8221; he requested. &#8220;That was a blamed
good scrap from what I can remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve told you about that scrap so much
I&#8217;m ashamed to tell it again,&#8221; replied the driver,
wishing that he could remember just what he had
said about it, and sorry that his memory was so
inferior to his imagination.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>&#8220;Bet you get scalped goin&#8217; back,&#8221; pleasantly
remarked Johnny Sands, who had not fought in the
Civil War, but who often ferociously wished he had
when old Pop Westley was telling of how Mead
took Vicksburg, or some other such bit of history.
Pop must have been connected to a flying regiment,
for he had fought under every general on the Union
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on for the drinks, Johnny,&#8221; answered
Bill promptly, feeling that it would be a double joy
to win. &#8220;The war-whoops never lived who could
scalp Bill Howland, and don&#8217;t forget it, neither,&#8221;
he boastfully averred as he made for the door, very
anxious to get away from that awful gnawing temptation
to open their eyes wide about his recent experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then The Orphan will get you, shore,&#8221; came
from Pop Westley. Bill jumped and slammed the
door so hard that it shook the building.</p>

<p>He saw that his sextet was being properly fed
and watered for the return trip, which would not
take place until the next day. But a trifle like
twenty-four hours had no effect on Bill under his
present stress of excitement, and he fooled about
the coach as if it was his dearest possession, inspecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
the king-bolt, running-gear and whiffletrees with
anxious eyes. He wanted no break-down, because
the Apaches <i>might</i> be farther north than was their
custom. That done he took his rifle apart and thoroughly
cleaned and oiled it, seeing that the magazine
was full to the end. Then he had his supper
and went straight therefrom to bed, not daring to
again meet his friends for fear of breaking his
promise to The Orphan.</p>

<p>At dawn he drew up beside the small station and
waited for the arrival of the train, which even then
was a speck at the meeting place of the rails on the
horizon.</p>

<p>The station agent sauntered over to him and
grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I will get that telegraph line after all,
Bill,&#8221; he remarked happily. &#8220;I heard that the division
superintendent wanted to get word to me in a
hurry the other day, and raised the devil when he
couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been fighting for a wire to civilization
for three years, and now I reckon she&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always said you ought to have a telegraph
line out here,&#8221; Bill replied. &#8220;Suppose that train
should run off the track some day, what would
they do, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>&#8220;Huh, that train never goes fast enough to run
off of anything,&#8221; retorted the station agent. &#8220;She&#8217;d
stop dead if she hit a coyote&#8211;by gosh! Here she
comes now! What do you think of that, eh?
Half-an-hour ahead of time, too! Must be trying
to hit up a better average than she&#8217;s had for the
last year. She&#8217;s usually due three hours late,&#8221; he
added in bewilderment. &#8220;She owes the world
about a month&#8211;must have left the day before by
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Johnny Sands says he raced her once for ten
miles, and beat it a mile,&#8221; replied Bill, crossing his
legs and yawning. Then he began one of his endless
talks, and the agent hastily departed and left
him to himself.</p>

<p>When the train finally stopped at its destination,
after running past the station and having to back
to the platform, three women alighted and looked
around. Seeing the stage, they ordered their baggage
transferred to it and gave Bill a shock by their
appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the stage which runs to Ford&#8217;s Station?&#8221;
the eldest asked of Bill.</p>

<p>Bill fumbled at his sombrero and tore it from his
head as he replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>&#8220;Yes, sir, er&#8211;ma&#8217;am!&#8221; he said, confusedly.
&#8220;Are you Sheriff&#8217;s sister, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Why do you ask? Has
anything happened to him in this awful country?&#8221;
she asked in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, not yet,&#8221; responded Bill in confusion.
&#8220;He just didn&#8217;t expect you &#8217;til the next train,
ma&#8217;am, that&#8217;s all. He was going to meet you then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, <i>isn&#8217;t</i> that just like a man?&#8221; she asked her
companions. &#8220;I distinctly remember that I wrote
him I would come on the twenty-fourth. How
stupid of him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, you did,&#8221; interposed Bill, eagerly.
&#8220;But this is only the twenty-first, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>She refused to notice the correction and waved
her hand toward the coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in, dears,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I <i>do</i> so hope it
isn&#8217;t dirty and uncomfortable, and we have so far
to go in it, too. Thirty miles&#8211;think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill thought of it, but refrained from offering
correction. If Shields had said it was thirty miles
when he knew it was eighty that was Shields&#8217; affair,
and he didn&#8217;t care to have any unpleasantness. He
had offered correction about the date, and that was
enough for him. Clambering down heavily he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
opened the side door of the vehicle and then helped
the station agent put the trunks and valises and hat
boxes on the hanging shelf behind the coach and
saw that they were lashed securely into place. Then
he threw the mail bag upon his seat, climbed after
it and started on his journey with a whoop and
rush, for this trip was to be a record-breaker.
Shields had said it was thirty miles, and it behove
the driver to make it seem as short as possible.</p>

<p>The unexpected arrival of the women had driven
everything else from his mind, even The Orphan,
and after he had covered a mile he had a strong
desire to smoke. Giving his whip a jerk he threw
it along the top of the coach and slipped the handle
under his arm. Then he felt for his pouch, and
as his fingers closed upon it he suddenly stiffened
and gasped. He had forgotten The Orphan&#8217;s half
pound! Swearing earnestly and badly frightened
at the close call he had from incurring the anger of
a man like the outlaw, he pulled on the reins with a
suddenness which caused the sextet to lay back their
ears and indulge in a few heartfelt kicks. But the
darting whip kept peace and he swung around and
returned to town.</p>

<p>As he drove past the station Mary Shields, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
sheriff&#8217;s elder sister, poked her head out of the door
and called to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Driver!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Driver!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill craned his neck and looked down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he replied anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we there already?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, ma&#8217;am, it&#8217;s ei&#8211;thirty miles yet,&#8221; he
responded as he sprang to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where are we, for goodness&#8217; sake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back in Sagetown, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he hurriedly replied.
&#8220;I shore forgot something,&#8221; he added in explanation
of the return as he ran toward the saloon.</p>

<p>She turned to her companions with a gesture of
despair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it awful,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;what a terrible
thing drinking is? A most detestable habit! Here
we are back to where we started from and just
because our driver must have a drink of nasty
liquor! Why, we would have been there by this
time. I will most assuredly speak to James about
this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose we may go on now!&#8221; she
exclaimed as Bill bolted into sight again, holding a
package firmly in his two hands. &#8220;I suppose he
feels quite capable of driving now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>Bill, blissfully ignorant of the remarks he had
called forth, tossed the tobacco upon the mail bag
and climbed to his seat again. The long whip
hissed and cracked as he bellowed to the team, and
once more they started for Ford&#8217;s Station.</p>

<p>The passengers had all they could do to keep
their seats because of the gymnastics of the erratic
stage. Bill, who had always found delight in seeing
how near he could come to missing things and
who was elated at the joy of getting over the worst
parts of the trail with speed, decided that this was
a rare and most auspicious occasion to show just
what he could do in the way of fancy driving. The
return to town had spoiled his chances for a record,
but he still could do some high-class work with the
reins. The weight of the baggage on the tail-board
bothered him until he discovered that it acted as a
tail to his Concord kite, and when he learned that
he joyously essayed feats which he had long
dreamed of doing. The result was fully appreciated
by the terrified passengers who, choking with
the dust which forced its way in to them, could only
hold fast to whatever came to their grasp and pray
that they would survive.</p>

<p>As he passed a peculiarly formed clump of organ
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
cacti, which he regarded as being his half-way
mark, he happened to glance behind, and his face
blanched in a sudden fear which gripped his heart
in an icy grasp.</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet, wrapping the reins about
his wrists, and the &#8220;blacksnake&#8221; coiled and writhed
and hissed. Its reports sounded like those of a
gun, and every time it straightened out a horse
lost a bit of hair and skin. Both of the leaders had
limp and torn ears, and a sudden terror surged
through the team, causing their eyes to dilate and
grow red. The driver&#8217;s voice, strong and full,
rang out in blood-curdling whoops, which ended in
the wailing howl of a coyote, wonderfully well imitated.
The combination of voice and whip was
too much, and the six horses, maddened by the
terrible sting of the lash and the frightful, haunting
howl, became frenzied and bolted.</p>

<p>Braced firmly on the footboard, poised carefully
and with just the right tension on the reins, the
driver scanned the trail before him, avoiding as best
he could the rocks and deep ruts, and watching
alertly for a stumble. His sombrero had deserted
him and his long brown hair snapped behind him
in the wind. Bill was frightened, but not for himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
alone. With all his bravado he was built of
good timber, and his one thought was for the
women under his care. He unconsciously prayed
that they might not be brought face to face with the
realization of what menaced them; that they would
not learn why the coach lurched so terribly; that
the trunk which obstructed the back window of the
coach would not shift and give them a sight of the
danger. Oh, that the running gear held! That
the king-bolt, new, thank God, proved the words
of the boasting blacksmith to be true! He soon
came to the beginning of a three-hundred-yard
stretch of perfect road and he hazarded a quick
backward glance. Instantly his eyes were to the
front again, but his brain retained the picture he
had seen, retained it perfectly and in wonderful
clearness. He saw that the Apaches were no longer
a mile away, but that they had gained upon him a
very little, so very little that only an eye accustomed
to gauging changing distances could have noticed
the difference. And he also saw that the group
was no longer compact, but that it was already
spreading out into the dreaded, deadly crescent, a
crescent with the best horses at the horns, which
would endeavor to sweep forward and past the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
coach, drawing closer together until the circle was
complete, with the stage as the center.</p>

<p>Another yell burst from him, and again and
again the whip writhed and hissed and cracked, and
a new burst of speed was the reward. Well it was
that the horses were the best and most enduring to
be found on the range. He was dependent on his
team, he and his passengers. He could not hope
to take up his rifle until the last desperate stand.
Oh, if he only had the sheriff, the cool, laughing,
accurate sheriff with him to lie against the seat and
shoot for his sisters! Already the bullets were
dropping behind him, but he did not know of it.
They dropped, as yet, many yards too short, and he
could not hear the flat reports. The wind which
roared and whistled past his ears spared him that.</p>

<p>A stumble! But up again and without injury,
for a master hand held the reins, a hand as cunning
as the eyes were calculating. Could Bill&#8217;s scoffing
friends see him now their scoffing would freeze on
lips open in admiring astonishment. If he attained
nothing more in his life he was justifying his creation.
He was doing his best, and doing it wonderfully
well. Long since had fear left him. He was
now only a superb driver, an alert, quick-thinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
master of his chosen trade. He thrilled with a
peculiar elation, for was he not playing his hand
against death? A lone hand and with no hope of
a lucky draw. All he could hope for was that he
be not unlucky and lose the game because of the
weakness of a wheel, or the traces, or that new king-bolt;
that the splendid, ugly, terrorized units of his
sextet would last until he had gained the cañon,
where the stage would nearly block the narrow
opening, and where he could exchange reins for
rifle!</p>

<p>Within the coach three women were miserably
huddled in a mass on the floor. Two would be
more proper, because the third, a slim girl of nineteen,
was temporarily out of her misery, having
fainted, which was a boon denied to her companions.
Thrown from side to side as if they were
straws in weight, they first crashed into one wall
and then into the other, buffeted from the edge of
the front seat to that of the rear one. Bruised
and bleeding and terrified, they dumbly prayed for
deliverance from the madman up above them.</p>

<p>The driver&#8217;s eye caught sight of the turn, which
lay ten miles northeast of the cañon&#8211;then he had
passed it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>&#8220;Only ten miles more, bronchs!&#8221; he shouted,
imploringly, beseechingly. &#8220;Hold it, boys! Hold
it, pets! Only ten miles more!&#8221; he repeated until
the left-hand leader lurched forward and lost its
footing. Another bit of masterly manipulation of
the reins saved it from going down, and again the
coyote yell rang out in all of its acute, quavering,
hair-raising mournfulness. The blacksnake again
and again mercilessly leaped and struck, and another
wonderful burst of speed rewarded him.</p>

<p>His heart suddenly went out to his horses, as he
realized what speed they were making and had been
holding for so long a time, and he swore to treat
them better than they had ever known if they pulled
him safely to the mouth of the cañon.</p>

<p>A second backward glance, forced from him because
of the awful uncertainty at his back, because
if it was the last thing he ever did he must look
behind him as a child looks back into the awful
darkness of the room, caused his face to be convulsed
with smiles, sudden and sincere. He shouted
madly in his joy at what he saw, dancing up and
down regardless of his perilous footing, bending his
knees with a recklessness almost criminal, as he
uncoiled the hissing blacksnake high up in the air.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
Again and again the whistling, hissing length
of braided rawhide curled and straightened and
cracked, faster and faster until the reports almost
merged. He tossed his head and laughed wildly,
hysterically, and danced as only a man can dance
when eased of a terrible nervous tension; the rasping
of the icy, grasping fingers of Death along his
back suddenly ceased, and there came to him assurance
of life and vengeance. Turning again he
hurled the writhing length of his whip at the yelling
Apaches, snapping the rifle-like reports at their
faces, cursing them in shouted words; hot, joyous,
cynical, taunting words fresh from the soul of him,
throbbing with his hatred; venomous, contemptuous,
scathing, too heartfelt to be over-profane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come <i>on</i>, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you! Your slide to h&#8211;l
is greased <i>now!</i> Come on, you wolves! You
cheap, blind vultures! Come on! <i>Come on!!</i>&#8221; he
yelled, well nigh out of his senses from the reaction.
&#8220;Yes, yell! Yell, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you!&#8221; he shouted as
they replied to his taunts. &#8220;Yell! Shoot your
tin guns while you can, for you&#8217;ll soon be so full of
lead you&#8217;ll stop forever! <i>Come on!</i> <span class='sc'>Come on</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>They came. All their energies were bent toward
the grotesque figure that reviled them. They could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
not catch his words, but their eyes flashed at what
they could see. Dust arose in huge, low clouds
behind them, and they gained rapidly for a time,
but only for a time, for their mounts had covered
many miles in the last few days and were jaded and
without their usual strength because of insufficient
food. But they gained enough to drop their shots
on the coach, although accurate shooting at the pace
they were keeping was beyond their skill.</p>

<p>Puffs of dust spurted from the plain in front of
the team and arose beside it, and a jagged splinter
of seasoned ash whizzed past the driver&#8217;s ear. A
long, gray furrow suddenly appeared in the end of
the seat and holes began to show in the woodwork
of the stage. One bullet, closer than the others,
almost tore the reins from the driver&#8217;s hands as it
hit the loose end of leather which flapped in the air.
Its jerk caused him to turn again and renew his
verbal cautery, tears in his eyes from the fervor of
his madness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi-yi! Whoop-e-e!&#8221; he shouted at his straining,
steaming sextet. &#8220;Keep it up, bronchs! Hold
her for ten minutes more, boys! We&#8217;ll win! We&#8217;ll
win! We&#8217;ll laugh them into h&#8211;l yet! We&#8217;ll
dance on their painted faces! Keep her steady!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
You&#8217;re all right, every d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d one of you! Hold
her steady! Whoop-e-e!&#8221;</p>

<p>A new factor had drawn cards, and the new
factor could play his cards better than any two men
under that washed-out, faded blue sky.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ORPHAN OBEYS AN IMPULSE</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>W</span>HEN Sneed promised to try to restrain his men he spoke in good faith,
and when he discovered that half of them were
missing his anger began to rise. But he was helpless
now because they were beyond his reach, so he
could only hope that they would not meet the sheriff,
not only because of the displeasure of the peace officer,
but also because good cowboys were hard to
obtain, and he knew what such a meeting might
easily develop into.</p>

<p>The foreman knew that Ford&#8217;s Station bore him
and his ranch no love and that if the sheriff should
meet with armed resistance and, possibly, mishap
at the hands of any members of the Cross Bar-8,
that trouble would be the tune for him and his men
to dance to. Angrily striding to and fro in front
of the bunk house he gave a profane and pointed
lecture to several of his men who stood near,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
abashed at their foreman&#8217;s anger. He suddenly
stopped and looked toward the rocky stretch of land
and hurled epithets at what he feared might be taking
place in its defiles and among its rocks and
bowlders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fools!&#8221; he shouted, shaking his fist at the
Backbone. &#8220;Fools, to hunt a man like that on his
own ground, and in the way you&#8217;ll do it! You
can&#8217;t keep together for long, and as sure as you
separate, some of you will be missing to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Had he been able, he would have seen six cowboys,
who were keeping close together as they
worked their way southward, exploring every
arroyo and examining every thicket and bowlder.
Their Colts were in their hands and their nerves
were tensed to the snapping point.</p>

<p>They finally came to the stage road and, after a
brief consultation, plunged into it and scrambled up
the opposite bank, where they left one of their number
on guard while they continued on their search.
The guard found concealment behind a huge bowlder
which stood on the edge of the cañon above the
entrance. He lighted a cigarette, and the thin wisps
of pale blue smoke slowly made their way above
him, twisting and turning, halting for an instant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
and then speeding upward as straight as a rod. It
was strong tobacco and very aromatic, and when the
wind caught it up in filmy clouds and carried it
away it could be detected for many feet.</p>

<p>Five minutes had passed since the searchers had
become lost to sight to the south when something
moved on the other side of the cañon and then
became instantly quiet as the smoke streamed up.
The guard was cleverly hidden from sight, but he
felt that he must smoke, for time passed slowly for
him. Again something moved, this time behind a
thin clump of mesquite. Gradually it took on the
outlines of a man, and he was intently watching
the tell-tale vapor, the odor of which had warned
him in time.</p>

<p>Retreating, he was soon lost to sight, and a few
minutes later he peered through a thin thicket which
stood on the edge of the cañon wall. As he did so
the guard stuck his head out from the shelter of his
bowlder and glanced along the trail. Again seeking
his cover he finished his cigarette and lighted
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t look again for a few minutes, the
fool,&#8221; muttered the other as he dropped into the
road and darted across it. After a bit of cautious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
climbing he gained the top of the cañon wall and
again became lost to sight.</p>

<p>Still the smoke ascended fitfully from behind the
bowlder, and the prowler gradually drew near it,
at last gaining the side opposite the smoker. He
crouched and slowly crawled around it, his left
hand holding a Colt; his right, a lariat. As the
guard again turned to examine the lower end of
the cañon his eyes looked into a steady gun, and
while his wits were rallying to his aid the rope
leaped at him and neatly dropped over his shoulders,
pinning his arms to his side. It twitched and
a loop formed in it, running swiftly and almost horizontally.
It whipped over his head and tightened
about his throat, while another loop sped after it
and assisted in throttling the puncher. Then the
lariat twitched and whirled and loops ran along it
and fastened over the guard&#8217;s wrists, rapidly getting
shorter; and when it ceased, its wielder was
brought to the side of his trussed victim. The
bound man was turning purple in the face and neck
and his captor, hastily crowding the guard&#8217;s own
neck-kerchief into the open, gasping mouth, released
the throat clutch of the rawhide and then securely
fixed the gag into place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>Roughly dragging his captive to a mass of débris
he tore it apart and dragged and pushed the man
into it, after which he pushed the rubbish back into
place and then ran to the bowlder, where he covered
all tracks. Picking up the puncher&#8217;s revolver
he took the cylinder from it and hurled it far out
on the plain, throwing the frame across the defile
into a tangled mass of mesquite. Looking carefully
about him, to be sure he had not overlooked
anything, he disappeared in the direction from
which he had come.</p>

<p>He again appeared in the cañon, and ran swiftly
along it until he came to the tracks made by the
guard&#8217;s horse, which he followed into an arroyo
and where he found the animal hobbled. Loosening
the hobbles he threw them over the horse&#8217;s
neck and sprang into the saddle. He picked his
way carefully until he had reached the level plain,
when he cantered northward, keeping close to the
rock wall of the Backbone to avoid being seen by
the searchers. When he had put a dozen miles
behind him he turned abruptly to the east, soon
becoming lost to sight behind the scattered chaparrals.</p>

<p>The Orphan, surmounting a rise, looked to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
southwest and saw something which almost caused
his hair to rise, and raising hair was not the rule
with him, which latter is mentioned to give proper
emphasis to the seriousness of what he looked upon.
He leaped to the ground and saw that the cinches
were securely fastened, after which he vaulted back
into the saddle, and, instead of offering prayer for
success, sent up profanity at the possibility of
failure.</p>

<p>Two miles to the southwest of him he saw six
horses flattened almost to earth in keeping the
speed they had attained and were holding. Back
of them lurched and rocked and heaved the sun-bleached
coach, dull gray and dusty, its tall driver
standing up to his work, hatless and with his arm
rapidly rising and falling as he sent the cruel whip
cruelly home. Behind the stage whipped the baggage
flap, a huge leathern apron for the protection
of luggage, standing out horizontally because of the
rush of wind caused by the speed of the coach. It
flapped defiantly at what so tenaciously pursued it.
A thousand yards to the rear, riding in crescent formation,
the horns now far apart and well ahead of
the center, were five arm- and weapon-waving
bronzed enthusiasts whose war paint could just be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
discerned by The Orphan&#8217;s good eyes and field
glasses.</p>

<p>As yet, the reason for the lifting hair has not
been disclosed, because The Orphan was proud in
his belief that he had few nerves and a dormant
sympathy, and this scene alone would not have
aroused much sympathy in his heart for the driver,
and neither would it have changed the malevolent
expression which disfigured his face, an expression
caused by the remembrance of six cowboys who had
searched for him as if he was a cowardly, cattle-killing
coyote. But the exuberant baggage-flap
revealed two trunks, three valises and a pile of
white cardboard boxes; and as if this was not
enough for a man adept at sign reading, the door of
the coach suddenly became unfastened and alternately
swung open and shut as the lurching of the
coach affected it. And through the intermittent
opening he could see a mass of gray and brown and
blue.</p>

<p>The Orphan had spent ten years of his life battling
against the hardest kinds of odds, and his
brain had foresworn long methods of thinking and
had adopted short cuts to conclusions. His mental
processes were sharp, quick and acted instantly on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
his nerves, often completing an action before he
became clearly conscious of its need. He forgot
the pleasant sheriff and the unpleasant, blundering
cowboys who, very probably, were now engaged in
wondering where their companion had gone; and
he forgot his determination to return and free that
puncher. He asked himself no questions as to why
or how, but simply sunk his spurs half an inch into
a horse that had peculiar and fixed ideas about their
use, and that now bucked, pitched and galloped
forward because its rider had suddenly decided
to save those gray and brown and blue dresses.</p>

<p>The Apaches had passed the point immediately
south of him and were now more to the west, going
at right angles to the course he took. They were
so intent upon gaining yard upon yard that they
did not look to the side&#8211;their thoughts were centered
on the tall, lanky man who stood up against
the sky and cursed them, and whose hat they had
passed miles back. As he turned and stole the
look at them which had so pleased him, they only
waved guns and wasted cartridges more recklessly,
yelling savagely.</p>

<p>Down from the north charged a brown, a dirty
brown horse, and it was comparatively fresh. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
gained steadily, silently, and its gains were measured
in yards to each minute it ran, since it was
coming at a sharp angle. Astride of it and lying
along its neck was a man whose spurs and quirt
urged it to its uttermost effort. Soon the man
straightened up in his saddle, the horse braced its
legs and slid to a stand as a rifle arose to the rider&#8217;s
shoulder, and at the shot the animal leaped forward
at its top speed. A puff of smoke flashed past
the marksman&#8217;s head to mingle with the dust cloud
in his wake, and the nearest brave, who was the last
in the crescent, dropped sprawlingly to the ground
and rolled rapidly several times. His horse, freed
of its burden, ran off at an angle and was soon left
behind. The excitement of the chase and the noise
of the hoofbeats of their own horses and of the
reports of their own rifles effectually lost the report
of the shot and soon another, and nearest, Apache
also plunged to the plain. This time the freed
horse shot ahead and ranged alongside the wearer
of the head-dress, who turned in his saddle and
looked back. His eyesight was good, but not good
enough to see the .50 caliber slug which passed
through his abdomen and tore the ear of another
warrior&#8217;s horse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>The rider of the horse owning the mutilated ear
looked quickly backward, screamed a warning and
war-cry all in one and began to shoot rapidly. His
surprised companion followed suit as the coach
came to a stand, and another rifle, long silent, took
a hand in the dispute with a vim as if to make up
for lost time. The first warrior fell, shot through
by both rifles, and the other, emptying his magazine
at the new factor, who was very busily engaged
in extracting a jammed cartridge, wheeled his pony
about and fled toward the south, panic-stricken by
the accuracy of the newcomer and terrorized by the
awful execution. But the Apache&#8217;s last shot nearly
cleaned the sheriff&#8217;s slate, grazing The Orphan&#8217;s
temple and stunning him: a fraction of an inch
more to the right would have cheated the Cross
Bar-8 of any chance of revenge.</p>

<p>Bill, still holding the rifle, leaped to the sand
and ran to where his rescuer lay huddled in the
dust of the plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got yore smoking,&#8221; he exclaimed breathlessly,
at last getting rid of his mental burden.
Then he stopped short, swore, and bent over the
figure, and grasping the body firmly by neck and
thigh, slung it over his shoulders and staggered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
toward the coach, his progress slow and laborious
because of the deep sand and dust. As he neared
his objective he glanced up and saw that his passengers
had left the stage and were grouped
together on the plain like lambs lost in a lion
country.</p>

<p>They were hysterical, and all talked at once, sobbing
and wringing their hands. But when they
noticed the driver stumbling toward them with the
body across his shoulders their tongues became suddenly
mute with a new fear. Up to then they had
thought only of their own woes and bruises, but
here, perhaps, was Death; here was the man who
had risked his life that they might live, and he
might have lost as they gained.</p>

<p>They besieged Bill with tearful questions and
gave him no chance to reply. He staggered past
them and placed his burden in the scant shadow of
the coach, while they cried aloud at sight of the
blood-stained face, frozen in their tracks with fear
and horror. Bill, ignoring them, hastily climbed
with a wonderful celerity for him, to the high seat
and dropped to the ground with a canteen which he
had torn from its fastenings. Pouring its contents
over the upturned face he half emptied a pocket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
flask of whisky into The Orphan&#8217;s mouth and then
fell to chafing and rubbing with his calloused, dust-covered
hands, well knowing the nature of the
wound and that it had only stunned.</p>

<p>Soon the eyelids quivered, fluttered and then flew
back and the cruel eyes stared unblinkingly into
those of the man above him, who swore in sudden
joy. Then, weak as he was and only by the aid
of an indomitable will, the wounded man bounded
to his feet and stood swaying slightly as one hand
reached out to the stage for support, the other instinctively
leaping to his Colt. He swayed still
more as he slowly turned his head and searched the
plain for foes, the Colt half drawn from its
holster.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gained his feet and while he
was looking about him in a dazed way the women
began to talk again, excitedly, hysterically. They
gathered around this unshaven, blood-stained man
and tried to thank him for their lives, their voices
broken with sobs. He listened, vaguely conscious
of what they were trying to say, until his brain
cleared and made him capable of thought. Then
he ceased to sway and spread his feet far apart to
stand erect. His hand went to his head for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
sombrero which was not there, and he smiled as
he recalled how he had lost it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how can we ever thank you!&#8221; cried the
sheriff&#8217;s eldest sister, choking back a nervous sob.
&#8220;How can we ever thank you for what you have
done! You saved our lives!&#8221; she cried, shuddering
at the danger now past. &#8220;You saved our
lives! You saved our lives!&#8221; she repeated excitedly,
clasping and unclasping her hands in her
agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we ever thank you, how can we!&#8221;
cried the girl who had fainted when the chase had
begun. &#8220;It was splendid, splendid!&#8221; she cried,
swaying in her weakness. She was so white and
bruised and frail that The Orphan felt pity for
her and started to say something, but had no chance.
The three women monopolized the conversation
even to the exclusion of Bill, who suddenly felt
that his talking ability was only commonplace
after all.</p>

<p>Blood trickled slowly down the outlaw&#8217;s face as
he smiled at them and tried to calm them, and the
younger sister, suddenly realizing the meaning of
what she had vaguely seen, turned to Bill with an
imperative gesture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>&#8220;Bring me some water, driver, immediately,&#8221;
she commanded impatiently, and Bill hurried
around to the rear axle from which swung a small
keg of three gallons&#8217; capacity. Quickly unsnapping
the chain from it he returned and pried out the
wooden plug, slowly turning the keg until water
began to flow through the hole and trickle down to
the sand. Miss Shields took a small handkerchief
from her waist and unfolded it, to be stopped by
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil that, miss!&#8221; he hastily exclaimed.
&#8220;Take one of mine. They ain&#8217;t worth much, and
besides, they&#8217;re a whole lot bigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, but this is better,&#8221; she replied,
smiling as she regarded the dusty neck-kerchief
which he eagerly held out to her. She wet the bit
of clean linen and Bill followed her as she stepped
to the side of the outlaw, holding the keg for her
and thinking that the sheriff was not the only thoroughbred
to bear the name of Shields. He turned
the keg for her as she needed water, and she bathed
the wound carefully, pushing back the long hair
which persisted in getting in her way, all the time
vehemently declining the eager offers of assistance
from her companions. The Orphan had involuntarily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
raised his hand to stop her, feeling foolish
at so much attention given to so trivial a wound
and not at all accustomed to such things, especially
from women with wonderful deep, black eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do not bother me,&#8221; she commanded,
pushing his hand aside. &#8220;You can at least let me
do this little thing, when you have done so much, or
I shall think you selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood as a bad boy stands when unexpectedly
rewarded for some good deed, uncomfortable because
of the ridiculous seriousness given to his gash,
and ashamed because he was glad of the attention.
He tried not to look at her, but somehow his eyes
would not stray from her face, her heavy mass of
black hair and her wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me think that I&#8217;m really hurt,&#8221; he
feebly expostulated as he capitulated to her deft
hands. &#8220;Now, if it was a real wound, why it
might be all right. But, pshaw, all this fuss and
feathers about a scratch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; she cried, dropping the stained handkerchief
to the ground as she took another from her
dress, plastering his hair back with her free hand.
&#8220;I suppose you would rather have what you call a
real wound! You should be thankful that it is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
worse! Why, just the tiniest bit more, and you
would have&#8211;&#8221; she shuddered as she thought of it
and turned quickly away and tore a strip of linen
from her skirt. Straightening up and facing him
again she ripped off the trimming and carefully
plucked the loose threads from it. Folding it into
a neat bandage she placed the handkerchief over
the wound after pushing back the rebellious hair
and bound it into place with the strip, deftly patting
it here and pushing it there until it suited her.
Then, drawing it tight, she unfastened the gold
breast-pin which she wore at her throat and pinned
the bandage into place, stepping back to regard her
work with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she cried laughing delightedly.
&#8220;You look real well in a bandage! But I am
sorry there is need for one,&#8221; she said, sobering instantly.
&#8220;But, then, it could have been much
worse, very much worse, couldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked,
smiling brightly.</p>

<p>Before The Orphan could reply, Bill saw a break
in the conversation, or thought he did, and hastened
to say something, for he felt unnatural.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got yore smokin&#8217;, Orphant!&#8221; he cried, clambering
up to his seat. &#8220;Leastawise, I had before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
them war-whoops&#8211;yep! Here she is, right side
up and fine and dandy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Could he have seen the look which the outlaw
flashed at him he would have quailed with sudden
fear. Three gasps arose in chorus, and the women
drew back from the outlaw, fearful and shocked
and severe. But with the sheriff&#8217;s younger sister
it was only momentarily, for she quickly recovered
herself and the look of fear left her eyes. So this,
then, was the dreaded Orphan, the outlaw of whom
her brother had written! This young, sinewy,
good-looking man, who had swayed so unsteadily
on his feet, was the man the stories of whose outrages
had filled the pages of Eastern newspapers
and magazines! Could he possibly be guilty of the
murders ascribed to him? Was he capable of the
inhumanity which had made his name a synonym
of terror? As she wondered, torn by conflicting
thoughts, he looked at her unflinchingly, and his
thin lips wore a peculiar smile, cynical and yet
humorous.</p>

<p>Bill leaped to the ground with the smoking tobacco
and, blissfully unconscious of what he had
done, continued unruffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n fine&#8211;begging the ladies&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
pardon,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Yes sir, it was plumb sumptious,
it shore was! And when I tell the sheriff how
you saved his sisters, he&#8217;ll be some tickled! You
just bet he will! And I&#8217;ll tell it right, too! Just
leave the telling of it to me. Lord, when I looked
back to see how far them war-whoops were from
my back hair, and saw you tearing along like you
was a shore enough express train, I just had to yell,
I was so tickled. It was just like I held a pair of
deuces in a big jack-pot and drew two more! My,
but didn&#8217;t I feel good! And, say&#8211;whenever you
run out of smoking again, you just flag Bill Howland&#8217;s
chariot: you can have all he&#8217;s got. That&#8217;s
straight, you bet! Bill Howland don&#8217;t forget a
turn like that, never.&#8221;</p>

<p>The enthusiasm he looked for did not materialize
and he glanced from one to another as he realized
that something was up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dears, let us go,&#8221; said Mary Shields,
lifting her skirts and abruptly turning her back on
the outlaw. &#8220;We evidently have far to go, and we
have wasted <i>so</i> much time. Come, Grace,&#8221; she
said to her friend, stepping toward the coach.</p>

<p>Bill stared and wondered how much time had
been wasted, since never before had he reached that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
point in so short a time. He had made two miles
to every one at his regular speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Helen!&#8221; came the command from the
elder, and with a trace of surprise and impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister! Why, Mary, how can you be so
mean!&#8221; retorted the girl with the black eyes, angry
and indignant at the unkindness of the cut, her face
flushing at its injustice. Her spirit was up in arms
immediately and she deliberately walked to The
Orphan and impulsively held out her hand, her
sister&#8217;s words deciding the doubts in her mind in
the outlaw&#8217;s favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive her!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t mean
to be rude! She is so very nervous, and this afternoon
has been too much for her. It was a man&#8217;s
act, a brave man&#8217;s act! And one which I will
always cherish, for I will never forget this day,
never, never!&#8221; she reiterated earnestly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care what they say about you, not a bit! I don&#8217;t
believe it, for you could not have done what you
have if you are as they paint you. I will not wait
for our driver to tell my brother about your splendid
act&#8211;he, at least, shall know you as you are, and
some day he will return it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she looked from him to her hand: &#8220;Will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
you not shake hands with me? Show me that you
are not angry. Are you fair to me to class me as
an enemy, just because my brother is the sheriff?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in wonderment and his face
softened as he took the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;You are kind,
and fair. I do not think of you as an enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen! Are you coming?&#8221; came from the
coach.</p>

<p>He smiled at the words and then laughed bitterly,
recklessly, his shoulders unconsciously squaring.
There was no malice in his face, only a quizzical,
baffling cynicism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; she cried, her eyes growing
moist. She made a gesture of helplessness and
looked him full in the eyes. &#8220;Whatever you have
done in the past, you will give them no cause to
say such things in the future, will you? You will
leave it all behind you and get work, and not be
an outlaw any more, won&#8217;t you? You will prove
my faith in you, for I <i>have</i> faith in you, won&#8217;t you?
It will all be forgotten,&#8221; she added, as if her words
made it so. Then she leaned forward to readjust
the bandage. &#8220;There, now it&#8217;s all right&#8211;you
must not touch it again like that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;You are alone in your faith,&#8221; he replied bitterly,
not daring to look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon not,&#8221; muttered Bill, scowling at
the stage as if he would like to unhitch and leave
it there. Then seeing The Orphan glance at the
horse which was grazing contentedly, he went out
to capture the animal. &#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d old hen, that&#8217;s
what she is!&#8221; he muttered fiercely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care
if she is the sheriff&#8217;s sister, that&#8217;s just what she is!
Just a regular ingrowing disposition!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are kind, as kind as you are beautiful,&#8221;
The Orphan responded simply. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed at his words and then decided that
he spoke in simple sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you are going to do differently,&#8221;
she replied as she extended her hand again.
&#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed his head as he took it and flushed:
&#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slowly turned and walked toward the coach,
where she was received by a chilling silence.</p>

<p>Bill brought the horse to where The Orphan
stood lost in thought, unbuckled his cartridge belt
and wrapped it around the pommel of the saddle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
the heavy Colt still in the holster. Then he clambered
up for his rifle and tied it to the saddle skirt
by the thongs of leather which dangled therefrom.
Looking about him he espied the keg on the sand
and, driving home the plug, slung it behind the
cantle of the saddle where he fastend it by the straps
which held the outlaw&#8217;s &#8220;slicker.&#8221; Jamming the
package of tobacco into the pocket of the garment
he stepped back and grinned sheepishly at his generous
gifts. He turned abruptly and strode to the
outlaw and shoved out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, pardner, shake!&#8221; he cried heartily.
&#8220;Yore the best man in the whole d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d cow country,
and I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em so, too, by God!&#8221;</p>

<p>The outlaw came out of his reverie and looked
him searchingly in the face as he gripped the
outstretched hand with a grip which made the
driver wince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Bill,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
get yourself disliked if you enthuse about me.&#8221;
Then he noticed the additions to his equipment and
frowned: &#8220;You better take those things, I can&#8217;t.
The spirit is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you borrow them &#8217;til you see me again,&#8221;
replied Bill. &#8220;You may need &#8217;em,&#8221; he added as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
he wheeled and walked to the coach. He climbed
to his seat and wrapped the lines about his hands,
cracking the whip as soon as he could, and the
coach lurched on its way to Ford&#8217;s Station, the
driver grunting about fool old maids who didn&#8217;t
know enough to be glad they were alive.</p>

<p>The Orphan hesitated about the gifts and then
decided to take them for the time. He mounted
and rode past the coach door, keeping near to the
flank of the last horse, where he listened to Bill&#8217;s
endless talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that you&#8217;ve got a Cross Bar-8
cayuse?&#8221; Bill asked at length, too idiotically happy
to realize the significance of his question.</p>

<p>The Orphan&#8217;s hand leaped suddenly and then
stopped and dropped to the pommel, and he looked
up at the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, one of their punchers and I sort of
swapped,&#8221; he laughingly replied, thinking of the
man under the débris. &#8220;Say, if I don&#8217;t get as far
as the cañon with you, just climb up above on the
left hand side near the entrance and release a fool
puncher that is covered up under a pile of rubbish,
will you? I came near forgetting him, and I don&#8217;t
want him to die in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>As he spoke he saw a group of horsemen swing
over a rise and he knew them instinctively.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the gang now&#8211;tell them, I&#8217;m off
for a ride,&#8221; he said, dropping back to the coach
door, where he raised his hand to his head and
bowed.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE OUTFIT HUNTS FOR STRAYS</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>A</span>S the group of punchers and the stage neared each other Bill saw two
horsemen ride out into view beside a chaparral half a mile to
the northwest, and he recognized Shields and Charley,
who were loping forward as if to overtake the
cowboys, their approach noiseless because of the
deep sand. As the cowboys came nearer Bill recognized
them as being the five worst men of the
Cross Bar-8 outfit, and his loyalty to his new friend
was no stronger than his dislike for the newcomers.
They swept up at a canter and stopped abruptly
near the front wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was <i>that?&#8221;</i> asked Larry Thompson impatiently,
with his gloved hand indicating the direction
taken by The Orphan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend of mine,&#8221; replied Bill, who was diplomatically
pleasant. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he began, enthusing
for effect, &#8220;you should have turned up sooner&#8211;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
missed a regular circus! We was chased by
five Apaches, and my friend cleaned &#8217;em up right,
he shore did! You should a seen it. I wouldn&#8217;t
a missed it for<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheese it!&#8221; relentlessly continued Larry, interrupting
the threatened verbal deluge. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be all day about it, Windy,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;who
is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, a friend of mine, Tom Davis,&#8221; lied Bill.
&#8220;He just wiped out a bunch of Apaches, like I
was telling you. They was a-chasing me some
plentiful and things was getting real interesting
when he chipped in and took a hand from behind.
And he certainly cleaned &#8217;em up brown, he shore
did! Say, I&#8217;ll bet you, even money, that he can
lick the sheriff, or even The Orphant! He&#8217;s a holy
terror on wheels, that&#8217;s what he is! Talk about
lightning on the shoot&#8211;and he can hit twice in
the same place, too, if he wants to, though there
ain&#8217;t no use of it when he gets there once. The
way he can heave lead is enough to make<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Choke it, Bill, choke it!&#8221; testily ordered Curley
Smith, whose reputation was unsavory. &#8220;Tell
us why in h&#8211;l he hit th&#8217; trail so all-fired hard. Is
yore friend some bashful?&#8221; he inquired ironically.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Bill, grinning exasperatingly,
&#8220;it all depends on how you looks at it. Women
say he is, men swear he ain&#8217;t; you can take your
choice. But they do say he ain&#8217;t no ladies&#8217; man,&#8221;
he jabbed maliciously, well knowing that Curley
prided himself on being a &#8220;lady-killer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; h&#8211;l he ain&#8217;t!&#8221; retorted Curley, with
a show of anger, preparing to argue, which would
take time; and Bill was trying to give the outlaw
a good start of them. &#8220;Th&#8217; h&#8211;l he ain&#8217;t!&#8221; he
repeated, leaning aggressively forward. &#8220;Yu
keep yore opinions close to home, yu big-mouthed
coyote!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you asked me, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; replied Bill.
&#8220;And I told you, didn&#8217;t I? He&#8217;s a good man all
around, and say, you should oughter hear him
sing! He&#8217;s a singer from Singersville, he is. Got
the finest voice this side of Chicago, that&#8217;s what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>real</i> interesting, and <i>just</i> what we was
askin&#8217; yu about,&#8221; replied Larry with withering
sarcasm. &#8220;An&#8217; bein&#8217; so, Windy, we&#8217;ll shore give
him all the music he wants to sing to before dark
if we gets him. Yore lying ability is real highfalutin&#8217;.
Now, suppose yu tell th&#8217; truth before we
drag it outen yu&#8211;who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>&#8220;You ought to know it by this time. Didn&#8217;t I
say his name is Tom Davis?&#8221; he replied, crossing
his legs, his face wearing a bored look. &#8220;How
many names do you think he&#8217;s got, anyhow? Ain&#8217;t
one enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look a-here!&#8221; cried Curley, pushing forward.
&#8220;Was that th&#8217; d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d Orphant? Come on, now,
talk straight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orphant!&#8221; ejaculated Bill in surprise. &#8220;Did
you say Orphant? Orphant nothing!&#8221; he responded.
&#8220;What in h&#8211;l do you think I&#8217;d be
lying about him for? Do I look easy? He ain&#8217;t
no friend of mine! Besides, I wouldn&#8217;t know him
if I saw him, never having seen that frisky gent.
Holy gee! is the Orphant loose in this country, out
here along my route!&#8221; he cried, simulating alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll take a chance anyhow,&#8221; interposed
Jack Kelly. &#8220;I can tell when a fool lies. If it <i>is</i>
yore friend Tom Davis we won&#8217;t hurt him none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest, you won&#8217;t hurt him?&#8221; asked Bill,
grinning broadly. &#8220;No, I reckon <i>you</i> won&#8217;t, all
right,&#8221; he added, for the sheriff was close at hand
now and was coming up at a walk, and Bill had an
abiding faith in that official. He could be a trifle
reckless how he talked now. He laughed sarcastically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
and hooked his thumbs in the armholes of
his vest. &#8220;Nope, I reckon <i>you</i> won&#8217;t hurt him,
not a little bit. Not if he knows you&#8217;re going to
try it on him. And if it should be Mister Orphant,
well, I hear that he&#8217;s dead sore on being hunted&#8211;don&#8217;t
like it for a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n. I also hear he drinks
blood instead of water and whips five men before
breakfast every morning to get up an appetite.
Oh, no, and you won&#8217;t hurt him neither, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yore real pert, now <i>ain&#8217;t</i> yu?&#8221; shouted Curley
angrily. &#8220;Yore a whole lot sassy an&#8217; smart, <i>ain&#8217;t</i>
yu? But if we find that he is that Orphant, we&#8217;ll
pay yu a visit so yu can explain just why yore so
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d friendly with him. He seems to have a
whole lot of friends about this country, he does!
Even the sheriff won&#8217;t hurt him. Even th&#8217; brave
sheriff loses his trail. Must be somethin&#8217; in it for
somebody, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better tell that to somebody else, the
sheriff, for instance. He&#8217;d like to think it over,&#8221;
responded Bill easily. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good chance to see
a little branding, a la Colt, as the French say.
Tell it to him, why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-tellin&#8217; it to yu, <i>now</i>, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell it to
Shields when I sees him, yu overgrown baby, yu!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
shouted Curley, his hand dropping to his Colt.
&#8220;Everybody knows it! Everybody is a-talkin&#8217;
about it! An&#8217; we&#8217;ll have a new sheriff, too, before
long! An&#8217; as for yu, if we wasn&#8217;t in such a hurry,
we&#8217;d give yu a lesson yu&#8217;d never forget! That
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d Orphant has got a pull, but we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
give him a push, an&#8217; plumb into hell! Either a
pull or our brave sheriff is some ascairt of him!
He&#8217;s a <i>fine</i> sheriff, <i>he</i> is, th&#8217; big baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasant afternoon, Curley,&#8221; came from behind
the group, accompanied by a soft laugh. The
voice was very pleasant and low. Curley stiffened
and turned in his saddle like a flash. The sheriff
was smiling, but there was a glint in his fighting
eyes that gave grave warning. The sheriff smiled,
but some men smile when most dangerous, and as
an assurance of mastery and coolness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looking for strays, or is it mavericks?&#8221; he
casually asked, a question which left no doubt as
to what the smile indicated, for it was a challenge.
Maverick hunting was at that time akin to rustling,
and it was occurring on the range despite the
sheriff&#8217;s best efforts to stop it.</p>

<p>Curley flushed and mumbled something about a
missing herd. He had suddenly remembered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
scene at the corral, and it had a most subduing
effect on him. The sheriff regarded him closely
and then noted the bullet holes in the coach. The
door of the vehicle was closed, the curtains down,
and no sound came from within it. The baggage
flap had settled askew over the tell-tale trunks and
hid them from sight on that side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a missing herd this time, is it?&#8221; he
inquired coolly. &#8220;Well, I reckon you won&#8217;t find
it out here. They don&#8217;t wander over this layout
while the Limping Water is running.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll take a look down south aways; it
won&#8217;t do no harm now that we&#8217;ve got this far,&#8221;
replied Larry. &#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve wasted too much time with th&#8217; engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; commanded the sheriff shortly.
&#8220;Your foreman made me certain promises, and I
reckon that you are out against orders. I wouldn&#8217;t
be surprised if Sneed wants you right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Larry laughed uneasily. &#8220;Oh, I reckon he ain&#8217;t losin&#8217;
no sleep about us. We won&#8217;t hurt nobody&#8221; &#8211;whereat Bill
grinned. &#8220;Come on, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you get what you&#8217;re looking
for,&#8221; replied the sheriff, whereat Bill snickered outright
and winked at Charley, who sat alert and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
scowling behind the sheriff, rather hoping for a
fight.</p>

<p>Larry flashed the driver a malicious look and,
wheeling, cantered south, followed by his companions.
They rode straight for the point at which
The Orphan had disappeared, Bill waving his arms
and crying: &#8220;Sic &#8217;em.&#8221; The chase was on in
earnest.</p>

<p>The stage door suddenly flew open with a bang
and interrupted the explanations which Bill was
about to offer, and in a flash the sheriff was almost
smothered by the attentions showered on him.
Laughing and struggling and delighted by the
surprise, the peace officer could not get a word
edgewise in the rapid-fire exclamations and questions
which were hurled at him from all sides.</p>

<p>But finally he could be heard as he extricated
himself from the embraces of his sisters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he cried, smiles wreathing his
face as he stepped back to get a good look at them.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a sight to make a sick man well! My,
Helen, but how you&#8217;ve grown! It&#8217;s been five
years since I saw you&#8211;and you were only a schoolgirl
in short dresses! And Mary hasn&#8217;t grown a
bit older, not a bit,&#8221; addressing the elder of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
two. Then he turned to the friend. &#8220;You must
pardon me, Miss Ritchie,&#8221; he said as he shook
hands with her. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve been looking forward
to this meeting for a long time. And I&#8217;m really
surprised, too, because I didn&#8217;t expect you all until
the next stage trip. I had intended meeting you
at the train and seeing you safely to Ford&#8217;s Station,
because the Apaches are out. I couldn&#8217;t get word
to you in time for you to postpone your visit, so I
was going to take Charley and several more of the
boys and escort you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he looked about for Charley, and found
that person engaged in conversation with Bill as
the two examined the bullet-marked stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Charley!&#8221; he cried, beckoning his
friend to his side. &#8220;Ladies, this is Charley Winter,
and he is a real good boy for a puncher. Charley,
Miss Ritchie, my sisters Mary and Helen. I
reckon you ladies are purty well acquainted with
Bill Howland by this time, but in case you ain&#8217;t,
I&#8217;ll just say that he is the boss driver of the Southwest,
noted locally for his oppressive taciturnity.
I reckon you two boys don&#8217;t need any introducing,&#8221;
he laughed.</p>

<p>Then, while the conversation throbbed at fever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
heat, Bill suddenly remembered and wheeled
toward the sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Orphant!&#8221; he yelled in alarm, hoping to
gain attention that way.</p>

<p>The sheriff and Charley wheeled, guns in hand,
and leaped clear of the women, their quick eyes
glancing from point to point in search of the
danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; cried the sheriff over his shoulder
at Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down south, ahead of them fool punchers,&#8221;
Bill exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;s only got a little start on
&#8217;em. And they know he&#8217;s there, too. That&#8217;s why
they&#8217;re looking for cows on a place cows never go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he related in detail the occurrences of the
past few hours, to the sheriff&#8217;s great astonishment,
and also to his delight at the way it had turned out.
Shields thought of his own personal experiences
with the outlaw, and this put him deeper in debt.
His opinion as to there being much good in his
enemy&#8217;s makeup was strengthened, and he smiled
at the fighting ability and fairness of the man who
had declared a truce with him by the big bowlder
on the Apache Trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope they don&#8217;t catch him!&#8221; Helen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
cried anxiously. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you do something,
James?&#8221; she implored. &#8220;He saved us, and he
is wounded, too! Can&#8217;t you stop them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff looked to the south in the direction
taken by the cow-punchers, and a hard light grew
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not now,&#8221; he replied decisively. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
had too much time now. And it&#8217;s safe to bet that
they rode at full speed just as soon as they got out
of my sight. They knew Bill would tell me.
They&#8217;re miles away by this time. But don&#8217;t you
worry, Sis&#8211;they won&#8217;t get him. Five curs never
lived that could catch a timber wolf in his own
country&#8211;and if they do catch him, they will wish
they hadn&#8217;t. And I almost hope they win the
chase, for they&#8217;ll lose their fool lives. It will be a
lesson to the rest of the bullies of the Cross Bar-8&#8211;and
small loss to the community at large, eh,
Charley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yore shore right, Jim,&#8221; replied Charley, smiling
at Miss Ritchie. &#8220;Did you ever hear tell of
the dog that retrieved a lighted dynamite cartridge?&#8221;
he asked her. &#8220;No? Well, the dog left
for parts unknown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, Charley,&#8221; Shields responded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
with a laugh. &#8220;The dog just wouldn&#8217;t mind, and
he was only a snarling, no-account cur at that,
wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Then he looked at the coach, and
his heart softened to the hunted man. &#8220;I can see
it all, now,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;Those punchers
must have forced him out of the Backbone, and he
was getting away when he saw the plight you were
in. By God!&#8221; he cried in appreciation of the act.
&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t no one man&#8217;s work, five Apaches! One
man stopping five of those devils&#8211;it was no work
for a murderer, not much! It was clean-cut nerve,
and if I ever see him I&#8217;ll tell him so, too! I&#8217;ll let
him know that he&#8217;s got some friends in this country.
They can say what they please, but there&#8217;s
more manhood in him to the square inch than
there is in all the people who cry him down; and
who are in a great way responsible for his being
an outlaw. I&#8217;m ready to swear that he never wantonly
shot a man down; no, sir, he didn&#8217;t. And I
reckon he never had much show, from what I
know of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen was real kind to him,&#8221; remarked the
spinster. &#8220;She bathed his wound and bandaged
it. Spoiled her very best skirt, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good girl, Sis,&#8221; Shields said, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
fondly at the beautiful girl at his side. His arm
went around her shoulder and he affectionately
patted her cheek. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you, and we&#8217;ll
have to see if we can&#8217;t get another &#8216;very best skirt,&#8217;
too.&#8221; Then he laughed: &#8220;But I&#8217;ll bet he blesses
the warrior who fired that shot&#8211;he&#8217;s not used to
having pretty girls fuss about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary looked quickly at her sister. &#8220;Why,
Helen! You&#8217;ve lost your gold pin! Where do
you suppose it has gone? I&#8217;ll look in the stage
for it before we forget about it. Dear me, dear
me,&#8221; she cried as she entered the vehicle, &#8220;this has
indeed been a terrible day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill grinned and turned toward his team. &#8220;I
reckon she&#8217;ll find it some day,&#8221; he said in a low
aside as he passed the sheriff. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just bet she
does. It&#8217;ll be in at the finish of a whole lot of
things, and people, too, you bet,&#8221; he added enigmatically.</p>

<p>Shields looked quickly at the driver, his face
brightened and he smiled knowingly at the words.
&#8220;I reckon it will; fool punchers, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill turned his head and one eye closed in an
emphatic wink. &#8220;Keno,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>Mary bustled out again, very much agitated. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
can&#8217;t find it. Where do you suppose you lost it,
dear? I&#8217;ve looked everywhere in the stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably back where we stopped before,&#8221;
Helen replied quietly. &#8220;We were so agitated that
we would never have noticed it if it slipped down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;&#8221; began Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use going back for it, Miss Shields,&#8221;
promptly interrupted Bill from his high seat.
&#8220;We just couldn&#8217;t find it in all that trampled sand,
not if we hunted all week for it with a comb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Bill,&#8221; gravely responded the
sheriff. &#8220;We never could.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they entered the defile of the Backbone the
sheriff suddenly remembered what Bill had told
him and he stopped and dismounted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep right on, Bill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
up to hunt that fool puncher. Lord, but it&#8217;s a
joke! This game is getting better every day&#8211;I&#8217;m
getting so I sort of like to have The Orphan
around. He&#8217;s shore original, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s better than a marked deck in a darkened
room,&#8221; laughed the driver. &#8220;He shore ought to
be framed, or something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You better go with them, Charley,&#8221; the sheriff
said as his friend made a move at dismounting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no danger, but we won&#8217;t take no
chances this time; we&#8217;ve got a precious coachful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Charley as he wheeled
toward the disappearing stage. &#8220;So long,
Sheriff.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff looked the wall over and then picked
out a comparatively easy place and climbed to the
top. As he drew himself over the edge he espied
a pair of boots which showed from under a pile
of débris, and he laughed heartily. At the laugh
the feet began to kick vigorously, so affecting the
sheriff that he had to stop a minute, for it was the
most ludicrous sight he had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>Shields grabbed the boots and pulled, walking
backward, and soon an enraged and trussed cow-puncher
came into view. Slowly and carefully
unrolling the rope from the unfortunate man, he
coiled it methodically and slung it over his shoulder,
and then assisted in loosening the gag.</p>

<p>The puncher was too stiff to rise and his liberator
helped him to his feet and slapped and rubbed
and chuckled and rubbed to start the blood in circulation.
The gag had so affected the muscles of
the puncher&#8217;s jaw that his mouth would not close
without assistance and effort, and his words were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
not at all clear for that reason. His first word was
a curse.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ell!&#8221; he cried as he stamped and swung his
arms. &#8220;&#8217;Ell! I&#8217;m asleep all o&#8217;er! <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>! &#8217;Ait
till I get &#8217;im! <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>! &#8217;Ait till I get &#8217;im!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of continuing the little nap you was taking
when he roped you, eh?&#8221; asked Shields, holding
his sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nap nothing! Nap nothing!&#8221; yelled the
other in profane denial. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t asleep, I tell
yu! I was wide awake! He got th&#8217; drop on me,
and then that cussed rope of his&#8217;n was everywhere!
Th&#8217; air was plumb full of rope and guns! I didn&#8217;t
have no show! Not a bit of a show! Oh, just
wait till I get him! Why, I heard my pardners
talking as they hunted for me, and there I was not
twenty feet away from them all the time, helpless!
They&#8217;re fine lookers, they are! Wait till I sees
them, too! I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em a few things, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon you may see one or two of
them, if they&#8217;re lucky&#8211;and you can&#8217;t beat a fool
for luck,&#8221; replied the sheriff. &#8220;They want to be
angels; they&#8217;re on his trail now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope they get him!&#8221; yelled the puncher,
dancing with rage. &#8220;Hope they burn him at th&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
stake! Hope they scalp him, an&#8217; hash him, an&#8217;
saw his arms off, an&#8217; cave his roof in! Hope they
make him eat his fingers and toes! Hope<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re some hopeful to-day,&#8221; responded the
sheriff. &#8220;If you like them, you better hope they
don&#8217;t get him. That&#8217;s hoping real hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till I get him!&#8221; the puncher repeated,
grabbing for his Colt, being too enraged to notice
its absence. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show him if he can tie a man up
an&#8217; leave him to choke to death, an&#8217; starve an&#8217;
roast! I&#8217;ll show him if he can run this country
like he owns it, shooting and abusing everybody
he wants to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Sonny,&#8221; Shields laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
shore wait till you gets him, if I live long enough.
But for your sake I shore hope you never finds him.
He wouldn&#8217;t get any more reputation if he killed
you, and your friends would miss you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yu let that worry yu!&#8221; retorted the
enraged man. &#8220;I can take care of myself in a
mix-up, all right! An&#8217; I&#8217;m going to chase after
my friends an&#8217; take a hand in th&#8217; game, too, by
God! He ain&#8217;t going to leave me high an&#8217; dry an&#8217;
live to boast about it! But I suppose you reckon
yu&#8217;ll stop me, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>Shields raised both hands high in the air in
denial. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of such a thing, not for
the world,&#8221; he cried, laughter shaking his big
frame. &#8220;You can go any place you please, only
<i>I&#8217;d</i> take a gun if I was going after <i>him</i>,&#8221; he added,
eyeing the empty holster. &#8220;You know, you <i>might</i>
need it,&#8221; he was very grave in his use of the subjunctive.</p>

<p>The puncher slapped his hand to his thigh and
then jumped high into the air: &#8220;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>! <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!&#8221;
he shouted. &#8220;Stole my gun! Stole my gun!&#8221;
Then he paused suddenly and his face cleared.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got something better&#8217;n a Colt on my
cayuse!&#8221; he cried as he leaped toward the edge of
the cañon. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll give him all it holds, too!&#8221;
he threatened as he bumped and slid to the bottom.
The sheriff took more care and time in descending
and had just reached the trail when he heard a
heart-rending yell, followed by a sizzling stream
of throbbing profanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my cayuse?&#8221; yelled the puncher as
he rounded the corner of the cañon wall on a
peculiar lope and hop. &#8220;Where&#8217;s my cayuse, yu
law-coyote?&#8221; he shouted, temporarily out of his
senses from rage. &#8220;Where&#8217;s my cayuse!&#8221; dancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
up to the sheriff and shaking both fists under the
laughter-convulsed face.</p>

<p>When the sheriff could speak, he leaned against
the cañon wall for support and broke the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bill Howland said as how The Orphan
was riding a Cross Bar-8 cayuse&#8211;dirty brown,
with a white stocking on his near front foot. It
had a big scar on its neck, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d hoss thief!&#8221; began the puncher,
but Shields kept right on talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a dandy Cheyenne saddle,&#8221; he said,
counting on his fingers, &#8220;a good gun, a pair of
hobbles and a big coil of rawhide rope on the
cayuse. Was they yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was they mine! Was they mine!&#8221; his companion
screamed. &#8220;My new saddle gone, my gun
gone and my fine rope gone! Oh, h&#8211;l! How&#8217;ll
I hunt him now? How&#8217;ll I get home? How&#8217;ll I
get back to th&#8217; ranch?&#8221; Words failed him, and
he could only wave his arms and yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it wouldn&#8217;t hardly be worth while chasing
him on foot without a gun, that&#8217;s shore,&#8221; the
sheriff said, grave once more. &#8220;But you can get
home all right; that&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I?&#8221; asked the puncher, eyeing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
sheriff&#8217;s horse and waiting for the invitation to ride
double on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, walk,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;It&#8217;s only about
twenty miles as the crow flies&#8211;say twenty-five on
the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk! Walk!&#8221; cried his companion, savagely
kicking at a lizard which looked out from a
crevice in the rock wall. &#8220;I never walked five
miles all at once in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;ll be a new experience, and you can&#8217;t
begin any younger,&#8221; replied Shields as he swung
into his saddle. &#8220;It&#8217;ll do you good, too&#8211;increase
your appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so hungry now I&#8217;m half starved,&#8221; replied
the other. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll pay up for all this, you see if
I don&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll get square with that d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d outlaw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know enough to be glad you were
found,&#8221; retorted the sheriff. &#8220;And if he hadn&#8217;t
told Bill where to look for you, you wouldn&#8217;t have
been, neither. You got off easy, Bucknell, and
don&#8217;t you forget it, neither. Men have been killed
for less than what you tried to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The puncher wilted, for twenty-five miles in
high-heeled boots, over rocks and sand, and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
an empty stomach, was terrible to contemplate, and
he turned to the sheriff beseechingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a lift, Sheriff,&#8221; he implored. &#8220;Take
me up behind you&#8211;I can&#8217;t walk all the way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields looked at the sun, which was nearing the
western horizon, and thought for a minute. Then
he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hadn&#8217;t ought to help you a step, not a
single, solitary step, and you know it. You tried
your best to run against me. You tried to hold
me up there by the corral, and then after I had
warned you not to go out for The Orphan you
went right ahead. Now you&#8217;re asking me to help
you out of your trouble, to make good for your
fool stupidity. But I&#8217;ll take you as far as the end
of the cañon&#8211;no, I&#8217;ll take you on to the ford, and
then you can do the rest on foot. That&#8217;ll leave
you ten or a dozen miles. Get aboard.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;A TIMBER WOLF IN HIS OWN COUNTRY&#8221;</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>W</span>HEN The Orphan said good-by to Bill he sat quietly in his saddle for a
minute watching the departing stage and wondered
how it was that he had the decency to avoid
a fight with the cowboys in the presence of the
women. Then Helen&#8217;s words came to him and he
smiled at the idea of peace when he would have to
fight the outfit before sundown. The heat of the
sun on his bare head recalled him from his mental
wanderings and he wheeled abruptly and galloped
along the trail to where he remembered that a tiny,
blood-stained handkerchief lay in the dust and sand.
Soon he espied it and, swinging over in the saddle,
deftly picked it up and regained his upright position,
his head reeling at the effort. Unfolding it
he examined the neat &#8220;H&#8221; done in silk in one corner
and smiled as he put it in his chaps pocket
where he kept his extra ammunition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;Peace and war in one pocket,&#8221; he muttered,
grinning at his cartridges&#8217; new and unusual companion.</p>

<p>Then he espied a Winchester near a fallen brave,
and he procured it as he had the handkerchief.
Describing an arc he picked up another, discarding
it after he had emptied the magazine, for ammunition
was what he wanted. Two Winchesters were
all right, but three were too many. As he threw
it from him he glanced through a slight opening in
the chaparral and saw the outfit approach the stage.
Then he galloped to where his sombrero lay, picked
it up and turned to the south for the Cimarron
Trail. When thoroughly screened by the chaparral
he pushed on with the swinging lope which his horse
could maintain for hours, and which ate up distance
in an astonishing manner. He had lost time in
going for his sombrero and the handkerchief, and
every minute before nightfall was precious. His
thoughts now bent to the problem of how either to
elude or ambush his pursuers, and the Winchesters
bespoke his forethought, for up to six hundred
yards they were not a pleasant proposition to face.
If he eluded the cowboys in the darkness he was
morally certain that they would take up his trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
at dawn, and what distance he had gained would
be at the expense of the freshness of his horse.
While he would average ten miles an hour through
the night, their mounts, freshened by a night&#8217;s rest,
might cut down his gain before the nightfall of the
next day.</p>

<p>One of the Winchesters worked loose from its
lashings and started to slide toward the ground.
He quickly grasped it and made it secure, smiling
at the number of rifles he had had and lost during
the past three weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny how this country has been shedding
Winchesters lately,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;There was the
five I got by the big bowlder, which I lost playing
tag with that d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d Cross Bar-8 gang, and here&#8217;s
two more, and I just left three what I didn&#8217;t want.
Well, they&#8217;re real handy for stopping a rush, and
I reckons that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m up against this time. If
I can find a likely spot for a scrap before dark I
may stop that gang in bang-up style, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later he caught sight of a moving
body of horsemen to the southeast of him and his
glasses enabled him to make them out.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Paches!&#8221; he exclaimed, and then he smiled
grimly and continued on his way toward them, taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
care to keep himself screened from their sight
by rises and chaparrals. His first thought had
been of danger, but now he laughed at the cards
fate had put in his hand, for he would use the
Indians to great advantage later on.</p>

<p>He counted them and made their number to be
twenty-two, which accounted for the five warriors
who had pursued the stage coach. The odds were
fine and he laughed joyously, recklessly: &#8220;All is
fair in love and war,&#8221; he muttered savagely.</p>

<p>Before the Indians had come upon the scene he
had been alone to face five angry and vengeful men,
and whom he had every reason to believe were at
least fair fighters. Had the positions been reversed
they would not have hesitated to make use of any
stratagem to save themselves&#8211;and here were two
contingents, both of which would take his life at
the first opportunity. He felt no distaste at the
game he was about to play; on the other hand, it
pleased him immensely to know that he was superior
in intellect to his enemies. They both wanted
blood, and they should have it. If they found too
much, well and good&#8211;that was their lookout. And
no less pleasing was the knowledge that he had sent
them north and that now he could make use of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
them. He wondered what they had been doing for
the last three weeks and why they were still in that
part of the country, but he did not care, for they
were where he wanted them to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two mad Apaches on the warpath
against five cow-wrastlers!&#8221; he exulted. &#8220;More
than four to one, and just aching to get square on
somebody! That Cross Bar-8 gang will have
something to weep about purty d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n soon! And
I shore hope they don&#8217;t get tired and quit chasing
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and waited when he had gained a
screened position from where he could look back
over his trail, and he had not long to wait, for soon
he saw five cowboys galloping hard in his direction.
Another look to the southeast showed him that the
war party was now riding slowly toward him, not
knowing of his presence, and they would arrive at
his cover at about the same time the cowboys would
come up. Neither the Indians nor the cowboys
knew of the proximity of the other, while The
Orphan could see them both. He glanced at the
thicket to the west of him and saw that it was thin,
being a connecting link between the two larger
chaparrals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you are on the jump,
bronch,&#8221; he said to his mount, &#8220;but I reckon you
can get through that, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboys disappeared from his sight behind
the northern chaparral, and as they did so he sunk
his spurs into his horse and rode straight at the
prickly screen and, going partly over and partly
through it, galloped westward as the war party and
the ranch contingent met. The shots and yells were
as music to his ears, and he bowed in mockery and
waved his hand at the turmoil as he made his
escape. The timber wolf had won.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CROSS BAR-8 LOSES SLEEP</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>S</span>NEED was angry, which could be seen by the way he talked, ate, moved and
swore. He had many cattle to care for and they were
strewn over six hundred square miles of territory.
The work was hard enough when he had his full
dozen punchers, but now it forced groans from the
tired bodies of his men, who fell asleep while removing
their saddles at night, and who worked in a
way almost mechanical. The extra work was not
conducive to sweetness of temper, and he was continually
quelling fights among the members of the
outfit. Where only argument formerly would have
arisen over differences of opinion, guns now leaped
forth; and the differences were multiplied greatly,
and getting worse every day. Things which ordinarily
would have provoked no notice, or a laugh at
most, now caused hot words and surliness. And the
reason for the extra work was the continued absence
of five cow punchers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>Sneed, tired of cursing the missing men and of
offering himself explanations as to why they had
not returned, fell, instead, to planning an appropriate
reception for them on their return to the ranch.
He needed no rehearsing, for while he did not
know in just what manner he would reveal his ideas
concerning them, he knew what his ideas were and
he had always been good at extemporizing when
under pressure, and he was under pressure now if
he had ever been.</p>

<p>The extra work was hard enough in itself to
cause his anger to rise and to create sensitiveness
and surliness on the part of his men, but it was only
one factor of his discontent. Busy all day at driving
the scattered cattle away from the Backbone
and closer to the ranch proper where they would be
less likely to fall prey to Apache raiders; working
all day from the first sign of dawn to the prohibitive
blackness of the night, they could have stood
up under the strain, for these were men of iron,
inured to hardships and constant riding. But hardy
as they were there was one thing which they must
have, and that was sleep. If they could have only
four hours of unbroken sleep when they threw themselves,
fully dressed with the exception of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
boots, in their bunks, they could have endured the
labor for weeks. But this was denied them, and
constantly on their minds were thoughts of fire,
slaughtered cattle and death.</p>

<p>For a week night had been a terror on the Cross
Bar-8. No sooner had the exhausted outfit fallen
asleep than bits of window glass would fly about
them, cutting and stinging. There was not a whole
window pane in the house and the door was so full
of lead that it sagged on its half-shattered hinges.
Cooking utensils were fast deserving premiums, for
hardly an unperforated tin could be found on the
premises. And their cook, a Mexican, who most
devoutly believed in a personal devil and a brimstone
hell, and who feared that he was living in
uncomfortable proximity to both, stood the strain
for just two nights and then, panic-stricken, had
fled from the accursed place and left them to get
their own meals as best they could. The protection
of the saints was all very well and good under
ordinary circumstances, but when they failed to stop
the bullets which passed through his cook shack
and which more than once had grazed him, it was
time for him to find some place far removed from
the Cross Bar-8, and where the devil was less
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
strong. When the saints allowed a devil-sped bullet
to completely shatter a crucifix it was time to
migrate, which he did, but in broad daylight when
the outfit had departed and when the devil was not
in evidence.</p>

<p>The interiors of both the ranch house and the
bunk house were wrecked. The clock, the pride of
the foreman, stood with half its wheels buried in the
wall behind it by a .50 caliber slug, its hands pointing
to half-past one. Lead filled the interior walls,
where opposite windows, and the holes and splinters
were a disgrace. Sombreros, equipment and the few
pictures the walls boasted were like tops of pepper
shakers. No sooner was a light shown than it became
the target for a shot, and more than one
wound gave proof as to the accuracy of the perpetrator.
So tired that they fell asleep at supper, the
men were constantly awakened by the noise of
devastation and the whining hum of the bullets.
Pursuit was a failure, and was also hazardous, as
proven by Bert Hodge&#8217;s arm, broken by a .50 caliber
slug from somewhere.</p>

<p>The two houses, wrecked as they were, were fortunate
when compared to the condition of the other
appurtenances of the ranch. Horses were found dead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
at all points, and always with a bullet hole in the center
of the forehead. The carcasses of cows dotted
the plain, and fire had half-destroyed the three corrals.
The three new cook wagons, unsheltered, were
denuded of bolts and nuts, and their tarpaulins were
hopelessly ruined. A wheel was missing from each
of them and their poles had been cut through in the
middle, the severed ends being found on the roof
of the ranch house three minutes after their crashing
descent had awakened the foreman, who heard
the hum and thud of a bullet as he opened the door.
The best grass had been burned off and the outfit
had fought fire on several nights when it should
have slept. And the small water hole near the cook
shack, which furnished water for the bunk house,
had been cleared of a dead calf on two mornings.
Scouting was of no avail, for the few remaining
horses (which now spent the night in the bunk
house) were as exhausted as their riders. Keeping
guard was a farce, for it had been tried twice, and
the guards had fallen asleep; and, awakened by
their foreman at dawn, found that their rifles, sombreros
and even their spurs were missing. With all
his hatred for The Orphan, Sneed was fair-minded
enough to give his enemy credit for being the better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
man. When the harassing outrages had first begun
and the foreman and his men were comparatively
fresh, he had given the matter his whole attention;
and he was no fool. But he had gained nothing
but a sense of defeat, which fact did not improve
his peace of mind or cause him to lose a whit of his
anger. Do what he could, plan as he might, he was
beaten, and beaten at every turn. He had to deal
with a man whose cunning and ingenuity were far
above the average; a man who, combining a rare
courage and a wonderful accuracy in shooting with
devilish strategy, towered far above the ordinary
rustler and outlaw. Sneed knew that he was absolutely
at the mercy of his persistent enemy and wondered
why it was that he did not steal up in the
night and kill the outfit as it slept, which was
entirely feasible. Finally, when the strain had
grown too much for even his iron nerves the sheriff
was implored to take command on the ranch and
give it his personal protection. The relations between
the sheriff and the ranch were not as cordial
as they might have been, and the asking of this
favor was gall and wormwood to the foreman and
his outfit.</p>

<p>When Shields arrived to take charge of the trouble,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
accompanied by Charley and two others, he
sought the foreman, for Charley had news of a
grave nature for the Cross Bar-8.</p>

<p>The foreman ran out of the bunk house and met
them near the corral, where the disagreement had
taken place.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the living God, Sheriff!&#8221; he cried, white
with anger. &#8220;This thing has got to stop if we have
to call out the cavalry! We can&#8217;t get a decent
breakfast&#8211;not a whole plate or pan in the house!
Our cayuses and cows are being slaughtered by the
score! And as for the rest of our possessions, they
are so full of holes that they whistle when the wind
blows!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I heard,&#8221; replied the sheriff. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do my
best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been doing our best, but what good is
it?&#8221; cried the foreman. &#8220;We are so plumb sleepy
we go to sleep moving about! We dassent show
our faces after dark without being made a target
of! Our new wagons are wrecks, the corrals destroyed
and the best grass made us fight for our
lives while it burned! That cursed outlaw has got
to be killed, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do our best, Sneed,&#8221; responded Shields.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
&#8220;I reckon we can stop it; at least we can give you
a good night&#8217;s rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are my five punchers?&#8221; Sneed asked;
his words bellowed until his voice broke. &#8220;And
Bucknell! D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n near dead before you found
him above the cañon, tied up like a package of
flour!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Charley can tell you about your men,&#8221;
Shields responded, viewing the devastation on all
sides of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about them?&#8221; cried the foreman
turning to the sheriff&#8217;s deputy, anger flashing anew
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Charley slowly began, &#8220;I was taking
a short cut this morning, and when I got to a place
about a dozen miles southeast of the mouth of Bill&#8217;s
cañon, I saw five bodies on the desert. They were
your cow-punchers, and they was so full of arrows
that they looked like big brooms. Apaches, I
reckon,&#8221; he added sententiously.</p>

<p>Sneed tore his hair and swore when he was not
choking.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after I told them to let up on that blasted
outlaw&#8217;s trail!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Where will it end,
between war-whoops and murders? What sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
a God-forsaken layout is this, anyhow? A man
can&#8217;t stick his nose out of his own house after dark
without having it skinned by a slug! He&#8217;s a
h&#8211;l of a hefty orphant, he is! Poor thing, ain&#8217;t
got no paw or maw to look after his dear little
hide! He needs a regiment of cavalry for a papa,
that&#8217;s what he needs, and a good strong lariat for
a mamma! Orphant! He&#8217;s a h&#8211;l of a sumptious
orphant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you trailed him?&#8221; asked the sheriff, having
to smile in spite of himself at the execution on
all sides of him, and at the foreman&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trailed him!&#8221; yelled Sneed, raising on his toes
in his vehemence. &#8220;Trailed him! Good God,
yes! But what good is it, what can we do when our
cayuses are so dod-gasted tired that they can&#8217;t catch
a tumble bug? Trailed him! Yes, we trailed him,
all right! We trailed him until we fell asleep in
the saddles on our sleeping cayuses! And while we
were gone, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d if he didn&#8217;t blow in and smash
up our furniture! We trailed him, all right; just
like a lot of cross-eyed, locoed drunken ants! We
had to wake each other up, and he could-a killed
the whole crowd of us with a club! And my
punchers who were so cock-sure they&#8217;d get him!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
How in h&#8211;l did they go and mess up with
Apaches? They wasn&#8217;t no fool kids!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time we saw them they were leaving
the stage to go south after him,&#8221; Charley said.
&#8220;They hadn&#8217;t got more than ten miles south when
they must have met the Apaches. I have a suspicion
that The Orphan had a hand in that meeting, but
how he did it I don&#8217;t know. But I know that the
spot was lovely for a head-on collision. Punchers
riding south would turn the corner of the chaparral
and run into the war party before they knowed it.
And I didn&#8217;t see The Orphant&#8217;s body laying around
all full of arrows, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed&#8217;s rage was pathetic. He almost frothed,
and tears stood in his blood-shot eyes. His neck
and his face were red as fire and the veins of his
neck and forehead stood out like whip-cords, while
his face worked convulsively. He was incapable of
coherent speech, his words being unintelligible
growls, a series of snarls, and he could only pace
back and forth, waving his arms and cursing wildly.</p>

<p>Shields glanced about the ranch and gave a few
orders, his men executing them without delay. One
man was to keep guard in the bunk house while
Sneed and his woe-begone men slept. The sheriff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
and Charley rode away toward the north to begin
the search for the outlaw; and there was to be no
quarter asked or given if his deputies had anything
to do with it.</p>

<p>The remaining deputy busied himself about the
ranch in executing a plan the sheriff had thought
out, and his actions were peculiar. First selecting
a position from which a man could command an
extensive view of the premises, he began to pace
off distances in all directions. The place was about
eight hundred yards west of the ranch house and
bunk house, and formed one angle of a triangle
with them; and from it it was possible to look in
through the windows of both of them. Any one
passing within good rifle range of either house
would show up against the lights in the windows;
and if a man had been covered over with sand on
that particular outlying angle, he could pick off the
intruder without being seen. The Orphan was due
to meet with a surprise if he paid his regular visit
the coming night.</p>

<p>The deputy, after completing his work to his
satisfaction found three more positions where they
respectively commanded the corrals, the wagons and
the rear of the bunk house. Then he paced more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
distances and was careful that bulky objects interposed
in the direct lines between the positions, this
latter precaution being to make it impossible for
the deputies to shoot each other. This done, he
went into the house and consulted with his companion
in arms, laughing immoderately about the
joke they would play on the marauder.</p>

<p>While Shields and Charley vainly searched the
plain and while the deputy paced and thought and
paced, and while Sneed and his exhausted cow-punchers
slept as if in death, safely under guard,
two men were riding along the Ford&#8217;s Station Sagetown
Trail well to the east of the Backbone,
chatting amicably and smoking the same brand of
tobacco. One of them sat high up in the air on
the seat of a stage coach, from where he overlooked
his six-horse team. His face was wreathed in grins
and his expression was one of beatific contentment.
The other cantered alongside on a dirty brown horse
which had a white stocking on the near front foot,
keeping close watch of the surrounding plain, his
mind active and alert.</p>

<p>Bill Howland laughed suddenly and slapped
his thigh with enthusiasm: &#8220;Say, Orphant,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;you are shore raising h&#8211;l with that Cross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
Bar-8 gang! You has got them so tangled up and
miserable that they don&#8217;t know where they are!
If their brains was money they&#8217;d have to chalk up
their drinks. They&#8217;re about as dangerous as ossified
prairie dogs. They remind me of the feller
who kicked a rattlesnake to see if it was alive, and
found out that it was. No, sir, they shore won&#8217;t
die of brain fever. Why, they ain&#8217;t had any sleep
for a week, have to work double hard, eat what
they can cook in sieve tins, and can&#8217;t say their soul&#8217;s
their own after dark. They could get rest if they
quit working one day and all but one get plenty of
sleep. Then the other feller could get his at night.
But they don&#8217;t know enough. Oh, it&#8217;s rich: the
whole blamed town is laughing at &#8217;em fit to bust.
It&#8217;s the funniest thing ever happened in these parts
since I&#8217;ve been out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he suddenly paused: &#8220;Say, Sneed sent a
puncher to town this morning. It was that brass-headed,
flat-faced Bucknell, what you tied up by the
cañon. He begged the sheriff to swear in a dozen
bad men and come out and protect his foreman and
the rest of the outfit. And the pin-headed wart
went and blabbed the whole thing right in front
of the Taggert&#8217;s saloon crowd, and he shore had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
to blow, all right. He shore did, and that gang&#8217;s
always thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horseman flecked the ashes from his cigarette
and smiled: &#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked, looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Shields took Charley Winter and the two
Larkin boys and went out to the ranch right after
the puncher went back. So you want to go easy
to-night or you&#8217;ll touch off some unexpected fireworks
and such. Shields and his men will stay out
there for several days and nights. That&#8217;ll give the
crazy hens a chance to rest up a bit nights. But
you be blamed careful about them pinwheels and
skyrockets or you&#8217;ll get burned some. Now, don&#8217;t
you even remember that <i>I</i> told you about it. I
wouldn&#8217;t-a said nothing at all, seeing as it ain&#8217;t none
of my business, only you went and got me out of a
tight place, and Bill Howland don&#8217;t forget a favor,
no siree! You gave me a square deal and a ace
full on kings with them animated paint shops, and
I&#8217;ll give you a lift every time I can. It wouldn&#8217;t
be a bad scheme to watch for me once in a while&#8211;I
might have some news for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s offer, plain as it was that he wished to help,
not only because he was in debt to the outlaw, but
also because he wished to have safe trips, touched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
the horseman deeply. Never in his life had The
Orphan been offered a helping hand from a
stranger; all he could hope for was to get the drop
first. He rode on silently, buried in thought, and
then, suddenly flipping his cigarette at a cactus,
raised his head and looked full at the man above
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You play square with me, Bill, and I&#8217;ll take
care of you,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The less you say, the
less apt you are to put your foot in it. I&#8217;ll hold my
mouth about your information, for if Shields knew
what you&#8217;ve just said he&#8217;d play a tune for you to
dance to. The Cross Bar-8 would shoot you before
a day passed. Any time you have news for me, tie
your kerchief to that cactus,&#8221; pointing to an exceptionally
tall plant close at hand. &#8220;Do it on your
outward trip. If I see it in time I&#8217;ll meet you somewhere
on the Sagetown end of the trail on your
return. I&#8217;m going back now, so by-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, and good luck,&#8221; replied Bill heartily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the handkerchief game, all right. Be some
cautious about the way you buzz around that
stacked deck of a Cross Bar-8 for the next few
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan wheeled and cantered back, making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
a detour to the south, for he had a plan to develop
and did not wish to be interrupted by meeting any
more hunting parties. Bill lashed his team and
rolled on his way to Sagetown, a happy smile illuminating
his countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t beat us, bronchs,&#8221; he cried to his
team. &#8220;Me and The Orphant can lick the whole
blasted territory, you bet we can!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ORPHAN PAYS TWO CALLS</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>S</span>HORTLY after nightfall a rider cantered along the stage route, fording
the Limping Water and rode toward the town, whose
few lights were bunched together as if for protection
against the spirits of the night. He soon
passed the scattered corrals on the outskirts of
Ford&#8217;s Station and, slowing to a walk, went carelessly
past the row of saloons and the general store
and approached a neat, small house some two hundred
yards west of the stage office. He appeared
careless as to being seen; in fact a casual observer
would have thought him to be some cowboy who
was familiar with the town and who feared the
recognition of no man. But while he had no fear,
he was alert; under his affected nonchalance nerves
were set for instant action. He was in the heart
of the enemy&#8217;s country, in the crude stronghold of
the Law, and if anything hostile to him occurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
it would happen quickly. And he was familiar
with the town, because he had on more than one
occasion ridden through and explored it, but never
before at such an early hour.</p>

<p>Arriving at his destination he dismounted and,
leaving his horse unrestrained by rope or strap,
walked boldly up to the door of the sheriff&#8217;s house
and knocked. Soon he heard footsteps within and
the door opened wide, revealing him standing hat
in hand and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said uneasily.</p>

<p>The sheriff&#8217;s wife stepped aside and the light
fell full on his face. For an instant she was at a
loss, and then the fresh scar on his forehead and
her husband&#8217;s good description came to her aid.
She gasped and stepped back involuntarily, astonished
at his daring. Her act allowed her companions
to see him and the effect was marked.
Miss Ritchie sat upright in expectation, her face
beaming, for this was as romantic and unexpected
as she could wish. Mary gasped and dropped her
hands to her side, not knowing what to do or say,
while Helen slowly laid her work aside and leaned
forward slightly, regarding him intently, a curious
expression on her face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;I only called to ask how the ladies were,&#8221; he
continued slowly, turning his hat in his hands,
apparently not noticing Mrs. Shields&#8217; surprise. &#8220;I
was afraid they might have&#8211;that their recent
experience might have bothered them some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently it was to be only a social call, and
Mrs. Shields owed something to this fair-minded
and chivalrous man. She smiled kindly, remembering
that the caller was rather well thought of
by her husband&#8211;he was not a man for women to
fear, whatever else he might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you come in?&#8221; she asked from the habit of politeness,
hardly expecting that he would do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I will be glad to for a minute,&#8221;
he responded, slowly stepping into the room,
where he suddenly felt awkward and not at all
comfortable.</p>

<p>Helen picked up her work to fasten a thread,
and he found himself marveling at the cleverness
of her fingers. Again laying the work aside, she
arose to meet him, a mischievous twinkle in her
dark eyes. It was so unusual to have been saved
by an outlaw whom her brother had tried to capture,
and still more unusual to have him dare to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
call on her in her brother&#8217;s own house, especially
after her sister&#8217;s direct cut at the coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you be seated?&#8221; she asked, indicating
her own chair by the light and taking his hat.
When the hat left him he suffered a loss, for he
had nothing to twist and grip. He replied by
dropping into the chair, not even seeing that it was
out of range of the door as a compliment to his
hostess. There was no sign of a weapon on him,
his holster being empty; but his blue flannel shirt
was unbuttoned, the opening hidden by his neck-kerchief.
He had, however, only put his Colt
there to have it out of sight, and not because he
feared trouble. Habitual caution was responsible
for the shirt being open, for he was not even sure
that he would fight if trouble should come upon
him, unless the women gave him a clear field.</p>

<p>Helen drew a chair from the wall and seated
herself in the semi-circle which faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad that your wound has healed
so nicely,&#8221; she said with a smile. &#8220;We are very
sorry that you were hurt in our defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it wasn&#8217;t anything,&#8221; he quickly replied,
smiling deprecatingly. &#8220;You fixed it up so nice
that it didn&#8217;t bother me at all&#8211;didn&#8217;t hurt a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;I am glad it was no worse,&#8221; she replied, looking
around the circle. &#8220;Grace, Mary, you surely
remember Mr.&#8211;Mr.<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please call me by the name you know me
by&#8211;The Orphan,&#8221; smiling broadly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve almost
forgotten that I ever had any other name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Orphan&#8211;how funny it sounds,&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s most original. Margaret, this is
the gentleman to whom we certainly owe our lives.
Oh! I know you don&#8217;t like to be reminded of it,&#8221;
she went on, answering his deprecatory gesture,
&#8220;no doubt you are accustomed to that sort of thing
out here, but in the East such an experience does
not often occur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad indeed to know and thank you,&#8221;
said Mrs. Shields, impulsively extending her hand.
&#8220;Your bravery has put me still deeper in your
debt. My husband&#8211;&#8221; her feelings overcame her
as she realized that this was the man who had
spared to her that husband, her laughing, burly,
broad-shouldered, big-hearted king of men. Was
it possible that this handsome, confident stripling
was his peer?</p>

<p>Helen relieved the tension: &#8220;Mr. Orphan, this
is Miss Ritchie, the same Miss Ritchie who was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
badly frightened when she first met you. Perhaps
you&#8217;ll remember it. And this<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t! I wasn&#8217;t one bit frightened!&#8221; declared
Miss Ritchie hotly, to The Orphan&#8217;s great
enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Grace, don&#8217;t fib&#8211;you can&#8217;t deny it.
And this is my sister who was mean enough to keep
her senses when I didn&#8217;t. We thought highly of
you then, but even more so now. You see, my
brother has been talking about you, he takes a keen
interest in you, Mr. Orphan&#8211;I declare I can&#8217;t help
laughing at that name, it sounds so funny; but you
will forgive me, won&#8217;t you? I knew you would.
Well, James has been saying nice things about you,
and so you see we know you better now. He likes
you real well, as well as you will let him, and I&#8217;m
awful sorry that he is not at home,&#8221; she dared, her
eyes flashing with delight. &#8220;I am sure he would
like to meet you very much; in fact he has said
as much. Oh, he speaks of you quite often.&#8221;</p>

<p>The caller flushed, but he was determined to let
them think him perfectly at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that he remembers me,&#8221; he responded
gravely. &#8220;I have only met him once, but
I thought he was rather glad to see me. We had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
a very enjoyable time together and I found him
very pleasant.&#8221; He was forced to smile as he
recalled the six Apaches in the sheriff&#8217;s rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen was just saying what awful risks her
brother ran,&#8221; Miss Ritchie remarked, intently
studying the rugged face before her. &#8220;But then,
he&#8217;s a man. If I was a man, I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid
of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, how brave you are, Grace,&#8221; laughed Mrs.
Shields. &#8220;I heard quite to the contrary about the
stage ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, Margaret!&#8221; retorted Miss Ritchie,
up in arms at the remark. &#8220;You would have been
afraid in that old coach if you had been banged
about in it as I was. The noise was terrible, and
that awful driver!&#8221;</p>

<p>The caller smiled at her spirit and then replied
to her, serious at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he does take chances,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
for that matter every man out in this country has
to run risks. Now, I&#8217;ve taken some myself,&#8221; he
added, smiling quizzically. &#8220;But, you know, we
get used to them after a while&#8211;we get used to
everything but hunger and thirst&#8211;and life. I&#8217;ve
even gotten used to being lonesome, and I find that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
it really isn&#8217;t so bad after all. And then, you
know, lonesomeness does have its advantages at
times, for it certainly promotes peace, and the cartridges
that it saves are worth considerable. But
it took me several years before I could accept it in
that light with any degree of ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen laughed merrily, for she most of all
appreciated this outcast&#8217;s humor, and she liked him
better the more he talked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in time I suppose one does become accustomed
to danger,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;although I&#8217;ll be
frank enough to admit that I don&#8217;t believe I could,&#8221;
glancing at her friend. &#8220;You risked much by
coming here to-night&#8211;just suppose that you had
called last night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The danger was only from a chance recognition
in the street,&#8221; he replied, smiling, &#8220;and it
would have been equally dangerous for the man
who recognized me, and perhaps more so, since I
was on the lookout&#8211;that balances. I would be
the last man anyone would expect to be in Ford&#8217;s
Station at this time, and once free of the town, I
could elude the pursuers in the dark. And as for
the sheriff, I knew that he was not at home to-night,
and, had he been so, I doubt if it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
have stayed me, for he is fair and square, and an
unarmed man is safe with him in his own house.
He understands what a truce means, and we had
one before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Shields smiled at him in such warmth that
he thanked his stars that he had played fair out by
the bowlder.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told us of that!&#8221; Helen exclaimed, laughingly.
&#8220;It was splendid of you, both of you. And,
do you know, I liked you much better for it. And
I wanted to meet you again and talk with you; I&#8217;m
dreadfully curious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen!&#8221; reproved her sister, and, turning
from the girl to him, she tried to explain away her
sister&#8217;s boldness. &#8220;You must excuse Helen, Mr.&#8211;Mr.
Orphan, because she is not a day older than
she was five years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mary!&#8221; cried Helen, reproachfully,
&#8220;how can you say that? Just the other day you
said that I was quite grown up and dignified. I
am sure that Mr.&#8211;oh, goodness, there&#8217;s that name
again!&#8221; she bewailed. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get
another name&#8211;that one sounds so funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan laughed: &#8220;I am not responsible for
the name, I had no hand in it. But, let&#8217;s see what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
we can do,&#8221; he said, counting on his fingers.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Smith, Brown, Jones&#8211;Jones sounds
well, why not say it?&#8221; he asked gravely. &#8220;I am
sure that&#8217;s easier to say and remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that <i>is</i> better!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221;
she said, experimenting. &#8220;Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones&#8211;oh,
pshaw, I like the other much better. I trust
that I&#8217;ll get accustomed to it in time, and I certainly
should, because I hear it enough; only then
it hasn&#8217;t that formal Mister before it. And it is
the Mister that causes all the trouble. Now, I&#8217;ll
try it again: I&#8217;m sure that The Orphan (I said
that real nicely, didn&#8217;t I?) I&#8217;m sure that The
Orphan doesn&#8217;t think me lacking in dignity, does
he?&#8221; she asked, regarding him merrily, and with
a dare in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now really,&#8221; he began, and then, seeing
the look of warning in her face, he laughed softly.
&#8220;Why, really, I think that you must be much more
dignified than you were five years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s such a neat evasion that I hardly know
whether to be angry or not,&#8221; she retorted, and
then turned to Miss Ritchie, who was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;for goodness sake, say
something! You don&#8217;t want me to do all the talking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
do you?&#8221; and before her friend could say a
word she began a new attack, her eyes sparkling
at the fun she was having.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done since I told you to behave
yourself?&#8221; she asked, assuming a judicial seriousness
which was extremely comical.</p>

<p>He laughed heartily, for she was so droll, her
eyes flashing so with vivacity, and so rarely beautiful
that he breathed deep in unconscious effort to
absorb some of the atmosphere she had created.
And he was not alone in his mirth, for Helen&#8217;s
audacity had caused smiles to come to Miss Ritchie
and Mrs. Shields, who were content to take no part
in the conversation, and even Mary forgot to be
serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t had time to do much,&#8221; he replied
in humble apology, &#8220;although I have been
occupied in a desultory way on the Cross Bar-8 for
a week, and before that I was quite busily engaged
in traveling for my health. You see, this climate
occasionally affects me, and I am forced to go
south or west for a change of air. I was just starting
out on my last trip when I first met you, and I
have reason to believe that my promptness in leaving
you saved me much annoyance. But I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
cooked quite a few meals in the interim&#8211;and I&#8217;ve
learned how mutton should be broiled, too. I&#8217;ll
have to confess, however, that I have been out late
nights. But then, I&#8217;ll have a better record to report
next time, honest I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen leveled an accusing finger at him: &#8220;You
spoiled all the cooking utensils on that ranch, and
you scared that poor cook so bad that he fled in
terror of his life and left those poor, tired men to
get all their own meals. Now, that was not right,
do you see? The poor cook, he was almost frightened
to death. I am almost ashamed of you; you
will have to promise that you will not do anything
like that again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise, cross my heart,&#8221; he replied eagerly,
thinking of the five dead punchers she had been
kind enough to overlook. &#8220;I solemnly promise
never to scare that cook again,&#8221; then seeing that
she was about to object, he added, &#8220;nor any other
cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll promise not to spoil any more tins,
or terrorize that poor outfit, or burn any more
corrals, and everything like that?&#8221; she asked
quickly, for she detected a trace of seriousness in
his face and wished to drive home her advantage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
If she could get a serious promise from him she
would rest content, for she knew he would keep
his word.</p>

<p>He thought for an instant and then turned a
smiling face to her. Seeing veiled entreaty in her
eyes, he suddenly felt a quiet gladness steal over
him. Perhaps she really cared about his welfare,
after all, though he dared not hope for that. He
grew serious, and when he spoke she knew that he
had given his word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise not to take the initiative in any warfare,
nor to harass the Cross Bar-8 unless they
force me to in self-defense,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>She hid her elation, for she had gained the point
her brother had failed to win, and did not wish to
risk anything by showing her feelings. As if to
reward him for yielding to her, she led the conversation
from the personal grounds it had assumed
and cleverly got him to talk about the country and
everything pertaining to it.</p>

<p>He was thoroughly at ease now, and for an hour
held them interested by his knowledge of the trails
and the natural phenomena. He told them of
cattle herding, its dangers and sports; and his
description of a stampede was masterly. He recounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
the struggles of the first settlers with the
Indians, and even quite extensively covered the
field of practical prospecting, lightening his story
with naïve bits of humor and witty personal opinions
which had them laughing heartily. It was not
long before they forgot that they were entertaining,
or, rather, being entertained by an outlaw;
and as for himself, it was the most pleasant evening
he had ever known. There was such an air of
friendliness and they were so natural and human
that he was stimulated to his best efforts; the barriers
had been broken down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, James says that you are a wonderful
shot!&#8221; cried Helen, interrupting his description of
a shooting match at a cowboy carnival he had once
attended in a northern town. &#8220;He says that no
man ever lived who could hope to beat you with
either rifle or revolver, six-shooter, as he calls it.
Won&#8217;t you let me see you shoot, some day?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed deprecatingly: &#8220;You ask the sheriff
to shoot for you,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;He can beat
me, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he can&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried impulsively, &#8220;because
he said he couldn&#8217;t. That was why he
couldn&#8217;t get you&#8211;&#8221; she stopped, horrified at what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
she had said. Then, determined to make the best
of it, and knowing that excuses or apologies would
make it worse, she hurriedly continued: &#8220;He says
that you are so fair and square that he just will not
take any advantage of you. He likes square people,
and he isn&#8217;t afraid to say it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan sat silently for half a minute, thinking
hard, while Mrs. Shields looked anxiously at
him. Here was peace and happiness. The sheriff
could come and go as he pleased, and every good
citizen was his friend. He had a home&#8211;a pleasant
contrast to the man who spent his nights under the
stars, not sure of his life from day to day, hounded
from point to point, having no friend, no one who
cared for him; he was just an outlaw, and damned
by his fellow men. Then he remembered what
Helen had said before leaving him at the coach.
She had faith in him, for she had told him so&#8211;and
she would not lie. Her kindness and faith in him,
an outcast, had been with him in his thoughts ever
since, and he had felt the loneliness of his life
heavily from that day. He felt a strange gnawing
at his heart and he slowly raised his eyes to her,
eagerly drinking in her radiant beauty, a beauty
wonderful to him, for never before had he seen a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
beautiful woman. To him women had always
been repellent&#8211;and no wonder. He scorned those
usually found in the cow towns. At their best they
were only ornaments, and to The Orphan&#8217;s mind
ornaments were trash. But now he suddenly awoke
to the fact that she was more, that she was all that
was worth fighting for, that she was the missing
half of his consciousness. And she herself had
given him heart for the fight, slight as it was, for
he was like a drowning man clutching at straws.
But still his cynicism swayed him and made him
fear that it would be a hopeless battle. Again he
thought of her brother and suddenly envied him,
and the liking he had felt for the sheriff became
strong and clear. Shields was a white man, just
and square.</p>

<p>He slowly raised his eyes to Mrs. Shields and
smiled, which caused her look of anxiety to clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sheriff is the whitest man in this whole
country,&#8221; he said quietly, a trace of his mood being
in his voice, &#8220;and only for that did I play square
with him. In confidence, just to let you know that
I am not as bad as people say, I will tell you that
I have had him under my sights more than once,
and that I will never try to harm him while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
remains the man he is. I do not exaggerate when
I say that I am naturally a good judge of men, and
I knew what he was in less than a minute after I
met him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this minute he is watching for me, he and
Charley Winter and the Larkin brothers. They
are lying quietly out on the plain, waiting for me
to show up between them and the lights of the
windows. This is not guesswork, for I know it.
And if it was only the sheriff, and I did show up
over his sights, he would call out and give me a
chance to surrender or fight, and not shoot me
down like a dog; the others wouldn&#8217;t. And because
of my faith in his squareness, and because I
above all others can fully appreciate it at its highest
value, I am going to ask you to remember this,
Mrs. Shields: If he ever needs a man to stand at
his back, and I can be found, he has only to let me
know. He is compromising himself with certain
people because he has been fair to me, so please
remember what I said. He is the sheriff, and he
only does his duty, for which I cannot blame him.
Bill Howland may be able to find me if trouble
should come upon you and yours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Others have hunted for me as if I was a cattle-killing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
wolf. They have tracked me and hounded
me in gangs, determined to shoot me down at the
first opportunity, and unawares, if possible. They
have laid traps for me, tried to ambush me, and
even stooped so low as to poison the water of a
remote water hole with wolf poison&#8211;strychnine.
They knew that I occasionally filled my canteen
from it. Those who fight me foully I repay in
kind&#8211;but never with poison! It is my wits and
gunplay against theirs and against their cowardice
and dirty tricks. When I fight, it is not because I
want to, except in the case of Indians, but because
I must. But your husband is a white man, madam,
a thoroughbred. He stands so far above the rest
of the men in this country that I have only respect
and liking for him. Can you imagine the sheriff
using poison to kill a man?</p>

<p>&#8220;Once when I had finally found a good berth
punching cows, once when I had started out aright,
I was discovered. They didn&#8217;t get me, though
they tried to hard enough. And they call me a
murderer because I declined to remain inactive
while they prepared for my funeral! Ever since
I was a lad of fifteen I have fought for my life at
every turn, and continually. I have no friends, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
a living soul cares whether I live or die. There is
no one whom I can trust, and no one who trusts
me. I have to be ever on the lookout, and suspicious.
Every man is my enemy, and all I have is
my life, worthless as it is. But pride will not let
me lose it without making a fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the time will come when you can see
me shoot, Miss Shields, that the time will come
when I can turn my back to my fellow men without
fearing a shot. Only once have I done that&#8211;it was
with your brother, and I enjoyed it immensely.
And no one will welcome that day more devoutly
than the outlawed Orphan&#8211;the many times murderer&#8211;but
by necessity: for I never killed a man
unless he was trying to kill me, and I never will.
I know what is <i>said</i>, but what I say is the truth. I
can only ask you to believe me, although I realize
that I am asking much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose and walked over to his sombrero, taking
it up and turning toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night is the first time in ten years that I
have been in a stranger&#8217;s house unarmed, and at
ease. You have made the evening so pleasant for
me, so delightfully strange, and you all have been
so good to talk to me and treat me white that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
find it impossible to thank you as I wish I could.
Words are hopelessly inadequate, and more or less
empty, but you will not lose by it,&#8221; he said as he
opened the door. &#8220;Good night, ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed softly, quickly, and the women
heard the cantering hoofbeats of his horse as they
grew fainter and finally died out on the plain.</p>

<p>His departure was seemingly unnoticed. They
sat in silence for a minute or more, each lost in her
own thoughts, each deeply affected by his words,
staring before them and picturing each as her
temperament guided, the hunted man&#8217;s dangers
and loneliness. Mrs. Shields sat as he had left her,
her chin resting in her hand, seeing only two men
in a chaparral, one of whom was the man she loved.
She could hear the shooting and the war cries, she
could see them meet, and clasp hands at the parting;
and her heart filled with kindly pity for the
outcast, a pity the others could not know. Helen,
her face full in the light, her arms outstretched on
the table before her and her eyes moist, wondered
at the savage unkindness of men, the almost unbelievable
harshness of man for man. Her head
dropped to her arms, and her sister Mary, also
under the spell, wondered at the expression she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
seen on Helen&#8217;s face. Miss Ritchie, who had
scarcely given more than a passing thought to the
sadness in his words, was picturing his fights,
drinking in the dash and courage which had so
exalted him in her mind. With all his loneliness,
his danger, she almost envied him his devil-may-care,
humorous recklessness and good fortune, his
superb self-confidence and prowess. Here was a
man who fought his own battles, who stood alone
against the best the world sent against him, giving
blow for blow, and always triumphing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shields stirred, glanced at Helen&#8217;s bowed
head and sighed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I understand why James likes him so.
Poor boy, I believe that if he had a chance he would
be a different and better man. James is right; he
always is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is just splendid!&#8221; cried Miss
Ritchie with a start, emerging from her dreams of
deeds of daring. &#8220;Simply splendid! Don&#8217;t you
Helen?&#8221; she asked impulsively.</p>

<p>Helen arose and walked to the door of her
room, turning her face toward the wall as she
passed them: &#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Good
night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;Oh, why are men so cruel!&#8221; she cried softly
as she paused before her mirror. &#8220;Why must
they fight and kill one another! It&#8217;s awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door had softly opened and closed and Miss
Ritchie&#8217;s arms were around her neck, hugging
tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> awful, dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But they can&#8217;t
kill <i>him!</i> They can&#8217;t hurt him, so don&#8217;t you care.
Come on to bed&#8211;I have <i>so</i> much to talk about!
Don&#8217;t put your hair up to-night, Helen&#8211;let&#8217;s go
right to bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen impulsively kissed her and pushed her
away, her face flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear, silly goose, do you think I am
worrying about him? Why, I had forgotten him.
I&#8217;m thinking about James.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course you are,&#8221; laughed Miss Ritchie.
&#8220;I was only teasing you, dear. But it <i>is</i> too bad
that nobody cares anything about him, isn&#8217;t it,
Helen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears trembled in Helen&#8217;s eyes and she turned
quickly toward the bed. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s his own
fault&#8211;oh, don&#8217;t talk to me, Grace! Poor James,
all alone out there on that awful plain! I&#8217;m just
as blue as I can be, so there!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>&#8220;Have a good, long cry, dear,&#8221; suggested Miss
Ritchie. &#8220;It does one <i>so</i> much good,&#8221; she added
as she stepped before the mirror. &#8220;But I think
he is just as splendid as he can be&#8211;I wish I was
a man like him!&#8221;</p>

<p>And while they played at pretending, the man
who was uppermost in their thoughts was playing
a joke on the sheriff at the Cross Bar-8 which
would open that person&#8217;s eyes wide in the morning.</p>

<p style='letter-spacing:4em; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;'>&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>On the ranch the darkness was intense and no
sounds save the natural noises of the night could
be heard. The sky was overcast with clouds and
occasionally a drop of rain fell. The haunting
wail of a distant coyote quavered down the wind
and the cattle in the corral were restless and uneasy.
A mounted man suddenly topped a rise at a walk
and then stopped to stare at the dim lights in the
windows of the houses nearly a mile away. He
laughed softly at the foolishness of the inmates
trying to plot for <i>his</i> death by doing something
they had not dared to do for a week. Who would
be so foolish as to ride up to those lighted windows
unless he was a tenderfoot?</p>

<p>Leaping lightly to the grass, he hobbled his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
horse and then took a bundle from his saddle,
which he strapped on his back and then went
quietly forward on foot, peering intently into the
darkness before him. Soon he dropped to his
hands and knees and crawled cautiously and without
a sound. After covering several hundred
yards in this manner he dropped to his stomach
and wriggled forward, his eyes strained for dangers.
A quarter of an hour elapsed, and then he
heard a sneeze, muffled and indistinct, but still a
sneeze. Avoiding the place from whence it came,
he made a wide detour and finally stopped, chuckling
silently. Untying the bundle he removed it
from his back and placed it upon a pile of sand,
which he heaped up for the purpose, and, printing
his name in the sand at its base, retreated as he
had come and without mishap. After searching
for a quarter of an hour for his horse he finally
found it, removed the hobbles and vaulted to the
saddle. Wheeling, he rode off at a walk, soon
changing to a canter, in the direction of the Limping
Water. When he had gained it he chanced
the danger of quicksands and rode north along the
middle of the stream. If he was to be followed,
the probability was that his pursuers would ride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
south to find where he had left the water; and they
must be delayed as long as possible.</p>

<p>An hour later daylight swiftly developed and a
peculiarly shaped pile of sand quaked and split
asunder as a man arose from it. He shook himself
and spent some time in digging the sand from
his pockets and boots and in cleaning his rifle of it.
Then he walked wearily toward the bunk-house,
whose occupants were still lost in the sleep of the
exhausted. It was very tedious to stay awake all
night peering at the lights in the distant windows;
and it was very hard to keep one&#8217;s eyes from closing
when lying in that position, and without any
sleep for twenty-four hours. The sheriff determined
to crawl into a bunk as soon as he possibly
could and be prepared for his next vigil.</p>

<p>As he glanced over the plain he espied something
which caused him to stare and rub his tired eyes,
and which immediately banished sleep from his
mind. Running to it, he suddenly stopped and
swore: &#8220;Hell!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>His wife&#8217;s blue flower pot sat snugly on the
apex of a pile of sand and from it arose a
geranium, which was tied to a supporting stick by
a white ribbon. He had whittled that stick himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
and he knew the flower pot. Roughly traced
in the sand at its base was one word&#8211;&#8220;Orphan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret&#8217;s geranium in its blue pot, by
God!&#8221; cried the sheriff, his mouth open in amazement.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d!&#8221; he exclaimed,
running toward the corral for his horse. &#8220;If that
son-of-a-gun ain&#8217;t been out here under my very nose
while I watched for him!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>M</span>ATTERS were fast coming to a head as far as the sheriff and the Cross
Bar-8 were concerned. The loss of the five
men who had won the friendship of their fellows,
the reign of terror caused by the outlaw, the loss of
their cook, the devastation and the extra work had
only deepened the hatred which the members of the
outfit held for The Orphan; and it went farther
than The Orphan.</p>

<p>Sneed was not long in learning what took
place at the stage and of the driver&#8217;s loyalty to the
outlaw, because Bill would talk; and the working
of his mind was the same as that of his men, for it
followed the line of least resistance. Questions of
the nature of arraignments, and which were answerable
by the outfit in only one way, constantly presented
themselves in the minds of the men. They
asked themselves why it was that a man of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
sheriff&#8217;s proven courage, marksmanship and cleverness
should fail to get the man who so terrorized
the ranch. Why was the sheriff so apparently
reluctant to take up the chase in earnest and push
it to a finish? Why was he so firm against the
assistance of the ranchmen? Why did he keep to
his determination to allow no lynch law when the
evil was so great and the danger so pressing? And
he was prepared to go to great lengths to see that
his orders were not disobeyed, as proven by the
scene at the corral. Why could he not have overlooked
one lynching party when property was being
destroyed and lives in danger? And why had the
outrages suddenly ceased when Shields took charge
of the defense of the ranch?&#8211;there had been no
molestation, not a shot had been fired, not a cow
killed. And how was it that a flower pot, which
Shields had admitted as belonging to his wife, had
been placed at a point hardly two hundred yards
in front of the peace officer as he lay on guard? It
was true that it was out of line of him and the
lights, but that could be explained by events. From
whom did The Orphan learn of the trap set for
him, and all of its details, even to the placing of
the men, enabling him to avoid the eager deputies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
and choose the position occupied by the sheriff
when he had so recklessly flaunted his contempt
from a pile of sand?</p>

<p>The cowboys were naturally enough warped and
prejudiced because of their blind rage and hatred,
and the questions which ran so riotously through
their minds found their answers waiting for them;
in fact, the answers induced the questions, and each
recurrence gave them added weight until they
ceased to be questions and became, in reality, statements
of facts. Bill had talked too much when he
had told in careful detail of the attentions shown
The Orphan by the sheriff&#8217;s sister; and to minds
eager for confirmation of their suspicions this was
the crowning proof of the double dealing of the
sheriff. And to make matters worse, Tex Williard,
who was as unscrupulous a man as ever wore the
garb of honesty, had tried to force his attentions on
Helen when she rode for exercise. His ideas of
women had been developed among those who
frequented frontier bar-rooms, and he was enraged
at his rebuff, which had been sharp and final. She
actually preferred a murdering outlaw to a hardworking
cowboy! His profane oratory as to the
collusion, or at least passive sympathy between the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
sheriff and the outlaw found eager ears and receptive
minds awaiting the torch of initiative, and it
was not long before low-voiced consultations began
to plan a drastic course of action. Credit must be
given to Sneed, because he knew only of the natural
discontent and nothing of what was in the wind.
Had he known what was brewing he would have
stamped it out with no uncertain force, for he was
wise enough to realize the folly of increasing the
antagonism which already was held by Ford&#8217;s Station
for his ranch.</p>

<p>At first the conspirators had hopes of undermining
Shields among the citizens of the town, not
knowing the feeling there as well as their foreman
knew it, but they were wise enough to go about it
cautiously; and the returns justified their caution,
for they found the inhabitants of Ford&#8217;s Station
unassailably loyal to the peace officer. To accuse
him, either directly or by suggestion, of double
dealing would be to array the two score inhabitants
of the town on his side in hot and belligerent partisanship,
and this they wished to avoid by all means,
for they had no stomach for such a war as might
easily follow. They then hit upon what appeared
to them to be an excellent plan, inasmuch as it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
indirect and would give the results desired; and the
medium was to be the driver.</p>

<p>The talkative one had shown more than passing
friendliness for The Orphan, and they had his
boasting words for it and he could not deny it, for
Bill was very proud of the part he had played on
that memorable day, and he took delight in recounting
the conversation he had held with the outfit at
the coach&#8211;and he had a way of adding to the tartness
of his repartee in its repetition. Tex Williard
reasoned from experience that it would not appear
at all strange and unusual for Bill to be called to
account for his friendliness and assistance to the
outlaw and for his contemptuous words concerning
the cowboys if it was done by some member or members
of the ranch as a personal affair and without
the appearance of being sanctioned by the foreman.
And through the driver he hoped to strike at
Shields, for the sheriff would not remain passive in
such an event; and once he was drawn into a brawl,
hot tempers or accident would be the plea if he
should be killed. The apologies and remorse of the
sorrowful participants could be profound. And
thus was cold-blooded murder planned by the very
men who reviled The Orphan because they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
claimed he was a murderer, and who cried aloud
for his death on that charge.</p>

<p>Tex was the ringleader and in his own way he
was not without cunning, and neither was he lacking
in daring. He selected his assistants for the
game with cool, calculating judgment. The three he
finally decided upon were reckless and not lacking
in intelligence and physical courage for such work.
After having made his selection he sounded them
carefully and finally made his plans known, going
into minute rehearsal of every phase and detail of
the game with thoughtful care and studied sequence.
When he believed them to be well drilled he fixed
upon the time and place and caused word to get to
Bill that he might expect trouble for his assistance
to The Orphan, and for having had a hand in
sending the five cowboys to their deaths. The news
immediately reached the ears of the sheriff, who
determined to see that Bill received no injury at the
hands of the Cross Bar-8. He quietly made up
his mind to be near the stage route on the days when
Bill drove through the defile of the Backbone, and
to be within call if he should be needed. If he
should think it necessary, he would even go so far
as to become a regular passenger in the coach until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
the trouble died down. To the masterly driving
and cool-headed courage of Bill no less than to the
daring and accuracy of The Orphan was the sheriff
indebted for the lives of his sisters; and the protection
of Bill clove close to the line of duty, and
not one whit less to the line of law and order.</p>

<p>Bill laughed and boasted and made a joke of the
thought of any danger from the malcontents of the
Cross Bar-8, and flatly refused to allow the sheriff
to ride with him. He talked volubly until the
agent profanely sent him on his journey, and he
tore through the streets of the town in the same
old way. He forded the Limping Water in safety
and crossed the ten mile stretch of open plain without
a sign of trouble. As he left the water of the
stream the sheriff started after him from town,
intending to be not far behind him when he entered
the rough country.</p>

<p>When Bill plunged into the defile through the
Backbone he began to grow a little apprehensive,
and he intently watched each stretch of the road as
each successive turn unfolded it to his sight. His
foot was on the brakes and he was braced to stop
the rush of his team at the first glimpse of an
obstruction, or to tear past the danger if he could.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
One coyote yell and one snap of the whip would
send the team wild, for they remembered well.</p>

<p>All was nice until he neared the place where The
Orphan had held him up for a smoke, and it was
there the trouble occurred. As he swung around
the sharp turn he saw four cowboys bunched
squarely in the center of the trail and at such a
distance from him that to attempt to dash past
them would be to lay himself open to several shots.
They had him covered, and as he grasped the situation
Tex Williard rode forward and held up his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; Tex shouted. &#8220;Get down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in thunder do you want?&#8221; Bill asked,
setting the brakes and stopping his team, wonder
showing on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yu!&#8221; came the laconic reply. &#8220;Get down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s eating you?&#8221; Bill asked in no uncertain
inflection. Had Tex been less imperative and
kept the insulting tone out of his words Bill might
have had time to become afraid, but the sting made
him leap over fear to anger; and genuine anger
takes small heed of fear.</p>

<p>Tex motioned to one of his men, who instantly
leaped to the ground and ran to the turn, where he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
knelt behind a rock, his rifle covering the back trail.
Then Tex returned to the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curiosity is eating me, yu half-breed!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;<span class='sc'>Get down</span>! d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n yu, <span class='sc'>get down</span>!!
Don&#8217;t wait all day, neither, do yu hear? What
th&#8217; h&#8211;l do yu think I&#8217;m a-talkin&#8217; for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be blamed!&#8221; ejaculated Bill, wrapping
the reins about the back of his seat. &#8220;Anybody
would think you was the boss of the earth to
hear you! You ain&#8217;t no road agent, you&#8217;re only a
fool amature with more gall than brains! But I&#8217;ll
tell you right here and now that if you <i>are</i> playing
road agent, I wouldn&#8217;t be in your fool boots for a
cool million. And if you are joking you are showing
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d bad taste, and don&#8217;t you forget it.
You&#8217;re holding up a sack of U. S. mail, and if you
don&#8217;t know what that means<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut yore face! Yu talk when I ask yu to!&#8221;
shouted Tex as the driver dropped to the ground.
&#8220;But since yore so unholy strong on th&#8217; palaver,
suppose yu just explains why yu are so all-fired
friendly to Th&#8217; Orphant? Suppose yu lisp why yu
take such a peculiar interest in his health and happiness.
Come now, out with it&#8211;this ain&#8217;t no Quaker
meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>&#8220;Warble, birdie, warble!&#8221; jeered one of the
cowboys. &#8220;Sing, yu <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span> <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re shore waitin&#8217;, darlin&#8217;,&#8221; jeered another.
&#8220;Tune up an&#8217; get started, Windy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you talks like that,&#8221; cried Bill,
stung to reckless fury at the cutting contempt of the
words, &#8220;you can go to h&#8211;l and find out from
your fool friends!&#8221; he shouted, beside himself with
rage. &#8220;Who are you to stick me up and ask questions?
It&#8217;s none of your infernal business who I
like, you hog-nosed tanks! Why didn&#8217;t you bring
some decent men with you, you flat-faced skunks?
Why didn&#8217;t you bring Sneed! White men would
a told you just what you are if you asked them to
help you in your dirty work, wouldn&#8217;t they? Even
a tin-horn gambler, a crooked cheat, would give me
more show for my money than you have, you bowlegged
coyotes! Ain&#8217;t you man enough to turn the
trick alone, Williard? Can&#8217;t you play a lone hand
in ambush, you bob-tailed flush of a bad man!
You&#8217;re only a lake-mouthed, red-headed wart of a
two-by-four puncher, that&#8217;s what<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex had been stunned by surprise at such an outburst
from a man whom he had always regarded as
woefully lacking in courage. Then his face flamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
with an insane rage at the taunting insults hurled
venomously at him and he sprang to action as
though he had been struck. It would have been
bad enough to hear such words from an equal, but
from Bill!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yu cur!&#8221; he yelled as he leaped forward into
the tearing sting of the driver&#8217;s whip, which had
been hanging from the wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the fourth dog I cut to-day,&#8221; Bill said,
jerking it back for another try.</p>

<p>Tex shivered with pain as the lash cut through
his ear, as it would have cut through paper, and
screamed his words as he avoided the second blow.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll show yu if I am man enough! I&#8217;ll kill yu for
that, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n yu!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Tex threw his arms wide open to clinch, Bill
leaped aside and drove his heavy fist into the cowman&#8217;s
face as he passed, knocking him sidewise
against the wall of the defile; and then struggled
like a madman in the toils of two ropes. He was
a Berserker now, a maniac without a hope of life,
and he screamed with rage as he tore frantically at
the rough hair ropes, wishing only to destroy, to
kill with his bare hands. The blow had not been
well placed, being too high for the vital point, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
it had smashed the puncher&#8217;s nose flat to his face
and one eye was fast losing its resemblance to the
other. Tex staggered to his feet and returned to the
attack, striking savagely at the face of the bound
man. Bill avoided the blow by jerking his head
aside and snarled like a beast as he drove the heel
of his heavy boot into his enemy&#8217;s stomach. Then
everything grew black before his eyes and a roaring
sound filled his ears. The rope slackened and
the men who had thrown him head-first on a rock
leaped from their horses and ran to him.</p>

<p>When his senses returned he found himself bound
hand and foot and under a spur of rock which
projected from the bank of the cut. His face was
cut and bruised and his scalp laid open, but through
the blood which dripped from his eyebrows he
vaguely saw Tex, bent double and rocking back and
forth on the ground, intoned moans coming from
him with a sound like that made by a rasp on the
edge of a box.</p>

<p>As Bill&#8217;s brain cleared he became conscious of
excruciating pains in his head, as if hammers were
crashing against his skull. Glancing upward he
saw that a rope ran from his neck to the rock, over
it and then to the pommel of a saddle, and his face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
twitched as its meaning sifted through his mind.
Then he thought of the time The Orphan had held
him up in the defile&#8211;how unlike these men the outlaw
was! If he would only come now&#8211;what joy
there would be in the flashing of his gun; what
ecstasy in the confusion, panic, rout that he would
cause. He was dazed and the throbbing, heavy,
monotonous pain dulled him still more. He seemed
to be apart from his surroundings, to be an onlooker
and not an actor in the game. He wondered
if that whip was his: yes, it must be . . . certainly
it was. He ought to know his own whip
. . . of course it was his. He regarded Tex
curiously . . . there had been Indians, or was
it some other time? What was Tex doing there
on the ground? He struggled to think clearly, and
then he knew. But the deadening pain was merciful
to him, it made him apathetic. Was he going to
die? Perhaps, but what of it? He didn&#8217;t care, for
then that pain wouldn&#8217;t beat through him. Tex
looked funny. . . . He closed his eyes wearily
and seemed to be far away. He <i>was</i> far away, and,
oh, so tired!</p>

<p>Tex finally managed to gain his feet and
straighten up and revealed his face, bloody and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
swollen and black from the blow. His words came
with a hesitation which suggested pain, and they
were mumbled between split and swollen lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n yu!&#8221; he cried, brokenly, staggering
to the helpless man before him. &#8220;Now
mebby yu&#8217;ll talk! Why did yu help Th&#8217; Orphant?
If yu lie yu&#8217;ll swing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill swayed and his eyes opened, and after an
interval he slowly and wearily made reply, for his
senses had returned again.</p>

<p>&#8220;He saved my life,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll help&#8211;anybody
for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he did, did he?&#8221; jeered Tex. &#8220;An&#8217; why?
That ain&#8217;t his way, helpin&#8217; strangers at his own
risk. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was women&#8211;in the coach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there was, hey?&#8221; ironically remarked Tex.
&#8220;Mebby he wanted &#8217;em all to himself, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a white man, not a cur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cub of th&#8217; devil, that&#8217;s what he is!&#8221;
Tex cried. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t no orphant, not by a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d
sight&#8211;th&#8217; devil&#8217;s his father, an&#8217; all hell is his
mother. Now, I want an answer to this one, and I
want it quick: no lie goes. Why don&#8217;t th&#8217; sheriff
get busy an&#8217; camp on his trail? What interest has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
th&#8217; sheriff an&#8217; Th&#8217; Orphant in each other? Come
on, out with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Bill, wishing that the
sheriff was at hand to make an appropriate answer.
&#8220;Ask him, why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked, stretching
his neck to ease the hairy, bristling clutch of the
lariat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yu don&#8217;t, an&#8217; yore still cheeky, eh?&#8221; cried
the inquisitor. &#8220;An&#8217; yu want yore d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d neck
stretched, do yu?&#8221;</p>

<p>He motioned to the man on the horse at the
end of the rope and Bill straightened up and daylight
showed under his heels. As he struggled
there was an interruption from the man who covered
the back trail: &#8220;&#8217;Nds up!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
move!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex signalled for Bill to be let down and ran
backward to the opposite side of the defile until
he could see around the turn; and he discovered the
sheriff, who sat quietly under the gun of the cowboy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Don&#8217;t yu even wiggle!&#8221; cried the
guard. &#8220;I&#8217;ll blow yore head off at the first
move!&#8221; he added in warning; and for once in his
eventful life Shields knew that he was absolutely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
helpless, for the time, at least. His hands were
clasped over his sombrero, for it would be tiresome
to hold them out, and he felt that he might have
need of fresh, quick muscles before long.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right, bub,&#8221; he responded in perfect
good nature, apparently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get nervous
and let that gun go off, for it&#8217;s shore your turn
now,&#8221; he added, smiling his war smile. &#8220;Any particular
thing you want, or are you just practicing
a short cut to eternity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want yu to stay just like yu are!&#8221; snapped
the man with the drop. &#8220;And yu keep yore mouth
shut, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s your last wish, why, it goes,&#8221; replied
the sheriff, ignoring the command for silence.
&#8220;Got any message for your folks? Any keep-sakes
you&#8217;d like to have sent back East? Give me the
address of your folks and I&#8217;ll send them your last
words, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Sheriff,&#8221; said Tex, moving cautiously
forward behind his leveled Colt. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do
all th&#8217; talkin&#8217; that&#8217;s necessary; yu just listen for a
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; replied the sheriff, grinning and
simulating surprise. &#8220;If here ain&#8217;t Tex Williard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
too! What&#8217;s your pet psalm, sonny? Good God,
what a face!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with this?&#8221; asked Tex,
intently watching for war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, nothing at all,&#8221; replied the sheriff.
&#8220;But, Lord, that cayuse of yours can shore
kick! Was you tickling it? They do go off like
that some times. Any of your nose coming out the
back of your head yet? But to reply to your touching
inquiry, I&#8217;ll say that the psalm might work in
handy after while, that&#8217;s all. If you&#8217;ll only tell
me, I&#8217;ll see that it is sung over your grave. But,
honest, how did you get that face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll just about do for yu!&#8221; cried the cowboy,
angrily. &#8220;An&#8217; sit still, yu!&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, bub,&#8221; confidentially said Shields, &#8220;my
stomach itches like blazes. Can&#8217;t I scratch it, just
once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Think I&#8217;m a fool!&#8221; yelled Tex, his finger
tightening on the trigger. &#8220;Yu sit still,
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n yu!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I only wanted to see just how much of
a fool you really are,&#8221; grinned the sheriff exasperatingly.
&#8220;Judging from your present position I must
say that I thought you didn&#8217;t have any sense at all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
but now I reckon you&#8217;ve got a few brains after all.
But suppose you scratch it for me, hey? Just rub
it easy like with your left paw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex swore luridly, too tense to realize what a
fool the sheriff was making of him. He could think
of only one thing at a time, and he was thinking
very hard about the sheriff&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, don&#8217;t take it so hard,&#8221; jeered the
sheriff, smiling pleasantly. &#8220;Now that I know that
you are some rational, suppose you tell me the joke?
What&#8217;s the secret? Who skinned his shin? What
in thunder is all this artillery saluting me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since yu want to know, I&#8217;ll tell yu, all right,&#8221;
replied Tex. &#8220;Why are yu an&#8217; Th&#8217; Orphant so
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d thick? Don&#8217;t be all day about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d excuse!&#8221; responded the sheriff.
&#8220;You mere accident! As the poet said, it&#8217;s none
of your business! Catch that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I caught it,&#8221; retorted Tex. &#8220;I reckon
we needs a new sheriff, an&#8217; d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d soon, too,&#8221; he
added venomously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, people don&#8217;t always get what they
need,&#8221; replied Shields easily. &#8220;If they did, you
would get yours right now, and good and hard,
too,&#8221; he explained, making ready to put up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
hardest fight of his life. Three men had him covered,
and he knew they would all shoot if he made
a move, for they had placed themselves in a desperate
situation and could not back out now. He
knew that never before had he been in so tight a
hole, but he trusted to luck and his own quickness
to crawl out with a whole skin. If he was killed,
he would have company across the Great Divide;
of that he was certain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll take yore guns for a while, just
to be doin&#8217; somethin&#8217;,&#8221; Tex said as he advanced a
step. &#8220;Mebby that itch will go away then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll be a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n sight wiser if you
don&#8217;t force matters, for they are purty well forced
now,&#8221; Shields replied. &#8220;No man gets my guns&#8217;
butts first without getting all mussed up inside.
You&#8217;ll certainly be doing something if you try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; compromised Tex, &#8220;answer my
question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And no man gets an answer to a question like
that in words,&#8221; the sheriff continued, as if there
had been no interruption. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll give you and
your white-faced bums a chance for your lives&#8211;and
I don&#8217;t wonder The Orphan shot up Jimmy,
neither. Put up your wobbling guns and get out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
of this country as fast as God will let you! If you
ever come back I&#8217;ll fill you plumb full of lead!
It&#8217;s your move, Lovely Face, and the quicker you
do it the better it&#8217;ll be for your health.&#8221;</p>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;&#8216;The less you count the longer you&#8217;ll live!&#8217; said Shields&#8221; (See page 192.)
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; replied Tex
with a leer and swagger. &#8220;To a man up a tree
it looks like yu are up agin a buzz saw this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a man on the ground it looks like your tin
buzz saw has hit the hardest knot it ever struck,
and you&#8217;ll feel the jar purty soon, too,&#8221; Shields
countered, his hazel eyes beginning to grow red.
&#8220;You put up that gun and scoot before I blow
your d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d head off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give yu &#8217;til I counts three to answer my
question,&#8221; Tex said, ignoring the advice. &#8220;One!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The less you count the longer you&#8217;ll live,&#8221;
said Shields, gripping his horse with his knees in
readiness to jump it sideways.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afternoon, gents,&#8221; said a pleasant voice up
above them, and all jumped and looked up. As
they did so Shields jerked his guns loose and
laughed softly: &#8220;That itch has plumb gone
away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new deal,&#8221; he exulted, his
face wreathed in grins.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW DEAL ALL AROUND</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>O</span>N the edge of the bank, thirty feet above them, a man squatted on his
heels, his forearms resting easily on his knees. In
each hand was a long-barreled Colt, held in a manner
oppressively businesslike. One of the guns was
leveled at the stomach of the man who guarded
Bill, and who still held the rope; the other covered
the man who had baited the sheriff. Shields took
care of the remaining two. One of the newcomer&#8217;s
eyes was half closed, squinting to keep out the
smoke which curled up from the cigarette which
protruded jauntily from a corner of his mouth. If
anything was needed to strengthen the air of pertness
of the man above it was supplied by his sombrero,
which sat rakishly over one ear. A quizzical
grin flickered across his face and the cigarette
bobbed recklessly when he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was you counting?&#8221; he asked of Tex in anxious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
inquiry. &#8220;And for God&#8217;s sake, who stepped
on your face?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex made no reply, for his astonishment at the
interruption had given way to the iron hand of
fear which gripped him almost to suffocation. In
the space of one breath he had been hurled from
the mastery to defeat; from a good fighting chance,
with all the odds on his side, to what he believed
to be certain death, for to move was to die. Had
it been anyone but The Orphan who had turned the
scale he would have hazarded a shot and trusted
to luck, for his gun was in his hand; but The
Orphan&#8217;s gunplay was as swift as light and never
missed at that distance, and The Orphan&#8217;s reputation
was a host in itself. He had threatened the
sheriff with death, he had used Bill worse than he
would have used a dog, and now his cup of bitterness
was full to overflowing. Above him a pair of
cruel gray eyes looked over a sight into his very
soul and a malevolent grin played about the thin,
straight lips of the man who had killed Jimmy,
who had led his five friends to an awful death, and
who had instilled terror night after night into the
hearts of seven good men. His mind leaped back
to a day ten years before, and what he saw caused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
his face to blanch. Ten years of immunity, but at
last he was to pay for his crime. Before him
stood the son of the man he had been foremost in
hanging, before him stood the man he had cruelly
wronged. His nerve left him and he stood a
broken, trembling coward, a living lie to the occupation
he had made his own, an insult to his dress
and his companions. Had he by some miracle
been given the drop he could not have pulled the
trigger. He now had no hope for mercy where he
had denied it. He had played a good hand, but he
had made no allowance for the joker, and no blame
to him.</p>

<p>No sooner had The Orphan spoken and the
sheriff discovered that he had things safely in his
hands, than Shields had leaped to the ground and
quickly disarmed his opponents, tossing the captured
weapons to the top of the bank near the outlaw.
Then he folded his arms and waited, laughing
silently all the while.</p>

<p>As soon as Shields had disposed of the last gun,
The Orphan gave his whole attention to the man
who was guarding Bill, and that person changed
the course of his hand just in time.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t try to use that gun, neither, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
I was you,&#8221; The Orphan said, still smiling. &#8220;You
can just toss it up on the bank over your head&#8211;that&#8217;s
right. Now drop that rope&#8211;I&#8217;m surprised
that you didn&#8217;t do it before. When you get Bill
all untangled from those fixings come right around
here, where I can see how nice you all look in a
bunch. It&#8217;ll take you one whole minute to get out
of sight around that turn, so I wouldn&#8217;t try any
running.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan was ignorant of the condition of
Bill&#8217;s face, since he had only seen the driver&#8217;s back
as he had crawled to the edge of the bank, and
now the bend in the opposite wall just hid Bill from
his sight. So he gave no great attention to the
driver, but turned to the sheriff and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that you would pull through, Sheriff,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t help having a surprise
party; I&#8217;m a whole lot fond of surprise parties, you
know. And it&#8217;s shore been a howling success, all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a very pleasant way of making yourself
useful,&#8221; Shields replied. &#8220;From the holes
you&#8217;ve pulled me out of within the past six weeks
you must have a poor impression of me. But seeing
that you have reason to laugh at me, I accept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
your apology and bid you welcome. It&#8217;s all
yours.&#8221; Then he glanced quickly up the trail and
his face went red with anger. &#8220;Hell!&#8221; he cried
in amazement.</p>

<p>The Orphan looked in the direction indicated
and he leaped to his feet in sudden anger at what
he saw. A man, followed by a cowboy, staggered
and stumbled drunkenly along the trail toward
them, his face a mass of cuts and bruises and blood.
His hair was matted with blood and dirt, and a
red ring showed around his neck. His hands
opened and shut convulsively and he made straight
as he could for Tex, who shrank back involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God! It&#8217;s Bill!&#8221; cried The Orphan,
hardly able to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the cur <i>I</i> want!&#8221; Bill muttered brokenly
to Tex, straightening up and becoming rapidly
steadier under the stimulus of his rage. &#8220;You&#8217;re
the <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span> <i>I</i> want, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you!&#8221; he repeated as he
slowly advanced. &#8220;It&#8217;s my turn now, you cur!
Lynch me, would you? Lynch me, eh? Tried to
hit me when I was tied, eh? Sicked your dogs on
me, eh? Keep still, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you&#8211;you can&#8217;t get
away!&#8221; he cried as Tex moved backward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand to it like a man, or I&#8217;ll blow your head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
off!&#8221; cried The Orphan from his perch. &#8220;Go on,
Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you wanted me, didn&#8217;t you? Do
you still want me?&#8221; he asked, not hearing The
Orphan&#8217;s words. &#8220;Are you still curious?&#8221; he
asked, backing Tex into a corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hash him up, Bill!&#8221; cried the man above,
and then, &#8220;Hey, wait a minute&#8211;I want to see
this,&#8221; he added as he slid down the bank. &#8220;Go
ahead with the slaughter&#8211;push his head off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s one hundred and eighty pounds of muscle
and rage suddenly hurled itself forward behind a
huge fist and Tex hit the bank and careened into
the dust of the trail, unconscious before he had
moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you you wasn&#8217;t man enough to play a
lone hand!&#8221; yelled the driver as he leaped after
his victim. But he was stopped by the sheriff, who
sprang forward and deflected him from his course.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough&#8211;no killing!&#8221; Shields cried,
regaining his balance and swiftly interposing himself
between the driver and Tex.</p>

<p>Bill didn&#8217;t hear him, for he had just caught sight
of the man who had told him to warble, and he
lost no time in getting to him. A few quick blows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
and the enraged driver left his second victim face
down in the dirt and passed on to the man who had
held the rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Bill!&#8221; yelled The Orphan, hopping
first on one foot and then on the other in his
joy. &#8220;Set &#8217;em up in the other alley! I didn&#8217;t
know you had it in you, Bill! Good boy!&#8221; he
shouted as Bill clinched with the third cowboy.
&#8220;Oh, that was a beauty! Right on the nose&#8211;oh,
what a whopper to get on the jaw! Whoop her
up! Fine, fine!&#8221; he laughed as Bill dropped his
man. &#8220;&#8216;And subsequent proceedings interested
<i>him</i> no more!&#8217; Next!&#8221; he cried as Bill wheeled
on the last of the group. &#8220;Eat him up, Bill!&#8211;that&#8217;s
the way! Just above the belt for his&#8211;Good!
All down!&#8221; he yelled madly as Bill, drawing
his arm back from the stomach of the falling
puncher, sent a swift uppercut hissing to the jaw.
&#8220;You lifted him five feet, Bill,&#8221; The Orphan
exulted as Bill wheeled for more worlds to conquer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the rest of the gang?&#8221; savagely
yelled the driver, looking twice at The Orphan
before he was sure of his identity. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the
rest of &#8217;em?&#8221; he shouted again, running around
the bend in hot search. &#8220;Come out and fight, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
cowards!&#8221; they heard him cry, and straightway
the outlaw and the guardian of the law clung to
each other for support as they cried with joy.</p>

<p>As Bill hurried back to the field of carnage one
of his victims was mechanically striving to gain his
hands and knees, to go down in a quivering heap
by a blow from the insane victor. As Bill drew
back his foot to finish his work, Shields broke from
his companion and leaped forward just in time to
hurl Bill back several steps. &#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you!&#8221; he
cried, standing over the prostrate figure, &#8220;If you
hit another man while he&#8217;s down I&#8217;ll trim you
right! Cool down and get some sense before I
punch it into you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan, leaning limply against the bank
of the defile, was making foolish motions with his
hands, which still held the Colts, and was babbling
idiotically, tears of laughter streaming down
his face and dripping from his chin. His eyes
were closed and he was bent over, rocking to and
fro against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; he sobbed senselessly. &#8220;Oh,
Lord, oh, Lord! Let me die in peace! Take him
away, take him away! Let me die in peace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a fine sight to hit Sagetown, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
yelled Bill, keeping keen watch on the four prostrate
punchers. &#8220;They&#8217;ll think I was licked!
They&#8217;ll point to my face and head and swear that
some papoose kicked the stuffing outen me! That&#8217;s
what they&#8217;ll do! But I&#8217;ll show them, all right!
I&#8217;ll just take my game with me and prove that I
am the best man, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do! I&#8217;ll pile &#8217;em
in the coach and lug &#8217;em with me!&#8221; grabbing, as
he finished, one of the men by the foot and dragging
him toward the stage. It took The Orphan
and Shields several strenuous minutes to dissuade
him from his purpose. Shields placed his fingers
on the bones of Bill&#8217;s hand in a peculiar grip, and
the driver loosened his hold without loss of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go back to town and get fixed up,&#8221; ordered
the sheriff. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take your team out of
this and turn them around, and then come back
for you. Charley can make the trip if you can&#8217;t.
I would do it myself, only I&#8217;ve got to tell Sneed
that he&#8217;s shy four more men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll turn &#8217;em around myself&#8211;I ain&#8217;t hurt,&#8221;
asserted Bill with decision. &#8220;And when I get
patched up I&#8217;ll make the trip, Pop Westley or no
Pop Westley. And I&#8217;ll lick the whole blamed
town, too, if they get fresh about my face! I&#8217;m a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
fighter from Fightersville, I am! I&#8217;m a man-eating
bad-man, I am! I can lick anything that
ever walked on hind legs, I can!&#8221; and he glared
as if anxious to prove his words.</p>

<p>After the cowboys regained consciousness and
got so they could stand, the sheriff lined them up
with their backs to the wall and gave them the
guns which The Orphan had obtained for him.
The outlaw held them covered while the sheriff
told them what they were, and he wound up his
lecture with instructions and a warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of this country and don&#8217;t never come
back!&#8221; he told them. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care where you
go, so long as you go right now. If you even
show your faces in these parts again I&#8217;ll shoot first
and talk after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here!&#8221; endorsed The Orphan, frowning
down his desire to laugh at the wrecks in front
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you next time!&#8221; shouted Bill, prancing
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cayuses are yours,&#8221; continued the sheriff.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll settle with Sneed if he has the gall to ask
about them. Now git!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex stared first at the sheriff and then at The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
Orphan and Bill as if doubting his ears. He was
ten years nearer the grave than he had been before
The Orphan had interrupted his counting. In less
than half an hour he had gone through hell, and
now he suddenly burst into tears from the reaction
and staggered to his horse, which he finally managed
to mount, a nervous wreck. &#8220;Oh, God!&#8221;
he moaned, &#8220;Oh, God!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others stared at him in amazement until he
had turned the bend, and then his companions
slowly followed him and were lost to sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n near dead from fright!&#8221; ejaculated
the sheriff. &#8220;I never saw anybody go to pieces
so bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He shore lost his nerve all right, all right,&#8221;
responded The Orphan. Then he turned to where
Bill stood looking after them: &#8220;Bill, you&#8217;re all
right&#8211;you can fight like h&#8211;l!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill slowly turned and grinned through the
blood: &#8220;Oh, that wasn&#8217;t nothing&#8211;you should
oughter see me when I get real mad!&#8221;</p>

<p style='letter-spacing:4em; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;'>&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>Two men rode side by side after a lurching
coach on their way toward the Limping Water,
both buried in thought at what the driver had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
told them. As they emerged from the defile and
left the Backbone behind, the elder looked keenly,
almost affectionately, at his companion and placed
a kindly hand on the shoulder of the man who had
turned the balance, breaking the long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Son, why don&#8217;t you get a job punching cows,
or something, and quit your d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d foolishness?&#8221;
he bluntly asked.</p>

<p>The younger man thought for a space, and a
woman&#8217;s words directed his reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that, and I&#8217;d like to do it,&#8221; he
said earnestly. &#8220;But, pshaw, who will give me a
try in this country?&#8221; he asked bitterly. Then he
added softly: &#8220;And I won&#8217;t leave these parts, not
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to leave the country,&#8221; replied
the sheriff. &#8220;Why not try Blake, of the Star C?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Blake is a shore square man, and he&#8217;s
a good friend of mine, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon he is square,&#8221; replied The
Orphan. &#8220;But he won&#8217;t take no stock in me, not
a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him that you&#8217;re a friend of mine, and
that I sent you to punch for him, and see,&#8221; responded
Shields, examining his cinch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>&#8220;Do you mean that, Sheriff?&#8221; the other cried
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell, yes!&#8221; answered Shields gruffly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give you a note to him, and if you watch your
business you&#8217;ll be his right-hand man in a month.
I ain&#8217;t making any mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; cried the outlaw.
&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Sheriff!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; replied
Shields, grinning broadly. &#8220;Mebby I just can&#8217;t
see the use of us shooting each other up, and that
is what it will come to if things go on as they are,
you know. I&#8217;d a blamed sight rather have you
behaving yourself with Blake than bothering me
with your fool nonsense and raising the devil all
the time. Why, it&#8217;s got so that every place I go
I sort of looks for flower pots!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan laughed: &#8220;I shore had a fine time
that night!&#8221;</p>

<p>When half way to the Limping Water the
sheriff said good-by to Bill and wheeled, facing in
the direction of the Cross Bar-8.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orphan, you wait for me at the ford,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going up to break the news to Sneed,
and I&#8217;ll get paper and pencil while I&#8217;m there, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
write a note to Blake. I&#8217;ll get back as quick as
I can&#8211;so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, and good luck,&#8221; replied The Orphan,
heartily shaking hands with his new friend.</p>

<p>Shields loped away and arrived at the ranch as
Sneed was carrying water to the cook shack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Sneed! Playing cook?&#8221; he said, pulling
in to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play <i>on</i> the cook if I ever get my hands on
him,&#8221; replied Sneed, setting the pail down. &#8220;Well,
what&#8217;s new? Seen Tex and the other three? I&#8217;ll
play on <i>them</i>, too, when they gets home! Off
playing hookey from work when we all of us aches
from double shifts&#8211;oh, just wait till I sees &#8217;em
sneaking in to bed! Just wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to give &#8217;em all a good thrashing,
they need it,&#8221; replied the sheriff, and then he
asked: &#8220;Got any paper, and a pencil?&#8221; He
wanted his needs supplied before he broke the
news, for then he might not get them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore as you live I have,&#8221; answered the foreman,
picking up the pail and starting toward the
bunk-house. &#8220;Come in and wet the dust&#8211;it&#8217;s hot
out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have the paper first&#8211;I want to scrawl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
a note before I forget about it,&#8221; the sheriff responded
as he seated himself on a bunk and looked
critically about him at the bullet-riddled walls and
pictures.</p>

<p>Sneed handed him an ink bottle and placed a
piece of wrapping paper and a corroded pen on
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That paper ain&#8217;t for love letters, the ink is
mud, and the pen&#8217;s a brush, but I reckon you can
make tracks, all right,&#8221; the host remarked as he
pushed a bench up to the table for his guest. &#8220;And
if them punchers don&#8217;t make tracks for home purty
lively, I&#8217;ll salt their hides and peg &#8217;em on the wall
to cure,&#8221; he grumbled, rummaging for a bottle
and cup. When he placed the tin cup on the table
he grinned foolishly, for it was plugged with a
cork. &#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d outlaw!&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; remarked the sheriff, fanning the note
in the air. &#8220;That&#8217;s done, if it&#8217;ll ever dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blow on it,&#8221; suggested Sneed, and then smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, wait a minute,&#8221; he said, stepping to the
door, where he scooped up a handful of sand.
&#8220;Throw this on it&#8211;it can&#8217;t get no muddier,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields carefully folded the missive and tucked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
it in his hip pocket, and then he looked up at the
foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sneed,&#8221; he slowly began, &#8220;your punchers ain&#8217;t
never coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; yelled the foreman, leaping to his
feet, and having visions of his men being cut up
by outlaws and Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; replied Shields with an air of finality.
&#8220;Bill Howland gave them the most awful beating
up that I ever saw men get, the whole four of
them, too! When he got through with them I
took a hand and ordered them to get out of the
country, and I told them that if they ever came
back I&#8217;d shoot on sight, and I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed&#8217;s rage was pathetic, and was not induced
by the beating his men had received, nor by the
sheriff&#8217;s orders, but because it left him only three
men to work a ranch which needed twelve. As
he listened to the sheriff&#8217;s story he paced back and
forth in the small room and swore luridly, kicking
at everything in sight, except the sheriff. Then he
cooled down, spread his feet far apart and stared
at Shields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you kill &#8217;em, the d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d fools?&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s what they deserved!&#8221; Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
he paused. &#8220;But what am I going to do?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Where&#8217;ll I get men, and what&#8217;ll I do &#8217;til
I do get &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send Charley and half a dozen of the boys
out from town to stay with you &#8217;til you get some
others,&#8221; replied the sheriff, walking toward the
door. &#8220;And you might tell the three that are left
that I&#8217;ll kill the next man who tries that kind of
work in this country. I&#8217;m getting good and tired
of it. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed didn&#8217;t hear him, but sat with his head in
his hands for several minutes after the sheriff had
gone, swearing fluently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orphan h&#8211;l!&#8221; he yelled as he picked up
the water pail and stamped to the cook shack.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STAR C GIVES WELCOME</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE Limping Water, within a mile after it passed Ford&#8217;s Station, turned
abruptly and flowed almost due west for thirty
miles, where it again proceeded southward. At
the second bend stood the ranch houses and corrals
of the Star C, in a country rich in grass and water.
Its cows numbered far into the thousands and its
horses were the best for miles around, while the
whole ranch had an air of opulence and plenty.
Its ranch house was a curiosity, for even now there
were lace curtains in some of the windows, badly
torn and soiled, but still lace curtains; and on the
floors of several rooms were thick carpets, now
covered with dust and riding paraphernalia. Oddly
shaped and badly scratched chairs were piled high
with accumulated trash, and the few gilt-framed
paintings which graced the walls were hanging
awry and were torn and scratched. At one time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
an Eastern woman had tried to live there, but that
was when the owner of the ranch and his wife had
been enthusiasts. New York regained and kept
its own, and they now would rather receive quarterly
reports by mail than daily reports in person.
The foreman and his wolf hounds reigned supreme,
not at all bothered by the stiff furniture and lace
curtains, because he would rather be comfortable
than stylish, and so lived in two rooms which he
had fitted up to his ideas. Carpets and two-inch
spurs cause profanity and ravelings, and as for pictures,
they have a most annoying way of tilting
when one hangs a six-shooter on one corner of the
frame, and they are so inviting that one is constantly
forgetting. So the unstable pictures, the
dress-parade chairs, bothersome curtains and
clutching carpets were left under the dust.</p>

<p>The Star C, being in a part of the country little
traversed and crossed by no trails, was removed
from the zone of The Orphan&#8217;s activities and had
no cause for animosity, save that induced by his
reputation. Several of its punchers had seen him,
and all were well versed in his exploits, for frequently
Ford&#8217;s Station shared its hospitality with
one or more of them; and in Ford&#8217;s Station at that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
time The Orphan was the chief topic of conversation
and the bone of contention. But the foreman
of the Star C would not know him if he should
see him, unless by intuition.</p>

<p>Blake was a man much after the pattern of
Shields in his ideas, and the two were warm friends
and had roughed it together when Ford&#8217;s Station
had only been an adobe hut. Their affection for
each other was of the stern, silent kind, which seldom
betrayed itself directly in words, and they
could ride together for hours in an understanding
silence and never weary of the companionship; and
when need was, deeds spoke for them. The Cross
Bar-8 would have had more than Ford&#8217;s Station
to fight if it had declared war on the sheriff, which
the Cross Bar-8 knew. The three cleverest manipulators
of weapons in that section, in the order of
their merit, were The Orphan, Shields and Blake,
which also the Cross Bar-8 knew.</p>

<p>The foreman of the Star C rode at a walk
toward a distant point of his dominions and cogitated
as to whether he could ride over to Ford&#8217;s
Station that night to see the sheriff. It was a
matter of sixty miles for the round trip, but it
might have been sixty blocks, so far as the distance
troubled him. He had just decided to make the
trip and to spend a pleasant hour with his friend,
and drink some of the delicious coffee which Mrs.
Shields always made for him and eat one of her
prize pies, or some of her light ginger bread, when
he descried a horseman coming toward him at a
lope.</p>

The Orphan gives Blake Shields&#8217; note. (<i>See page</i> 213.)
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>The newcomer was a stranger to Blake and
appeared to be a young man, which was of no
consequence. But the thing which attracted more
than a casual glance from the foreman was a certain
jaunty, reckless air about the man which spoke
well for the condition of his nerves and liver.</p>

<p>The stranger approached to within a rod of
Blake before he spoke, and then he slowed down
and nodded, but with wide-eyed alertness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are you the foreman of
the Star C?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy. I am,&#8221; replied the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I reckon this is yours,&#8221; said the stranger,
holding out a bit of straw-colored paper.</p>

<p>The foreman took it and slowly read it. When
he had finished reading he turned it over to see
if there was anything on the back, and then stuck
it in his pocket and looked up casually.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>&#8220;Are you The Orphan?&#8221; he asked, with no
more interest than he would have displayed if he
had asked about the weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied The Orphan, nonchalantly rolling
another cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is the sheriff?&#8221; Blake asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore well enough, but a little mad about the
Cross Bar-8,&#8221; answered the other as he inhaled
deeply and with much satisfaction. &#8220;He said
there was some good coffee waiting for you to-night
if you wanted it,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; asked Blake, grinning his delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and some&#8211;apricot pie,&#8221; added The
Orphan wistfully.</p>

<p>Blake laughed: &#8220;Well, I reckon I&#8217;ve got some
business over in town to-night, so you keep on
going &#8217;til you get to the bunk house. Tell Lee
Lung to rustle the grub lively&#8211;I&#8217;ll be there right
after you. Apricot pie!&#8221; he chuckled as he pushed
on at a lope.</p>

<p>Jim Carter was washing for supper, being urged
to show more speed by Bud Taylor, when the latter
looked up and saw The Orphan dismount. His
mouth opened a trifle, but he continued his urging
without a break. He had seen The Orphan at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
Ace High the year before, when the outlaw had
ridden in for a supply of cartridges, and he
instantly recalled the face. But Bud was not only
easy-going, but also very hungry at the time, and
he didn&#8217;t care if the devil himself called as long
as the devil respected the etiquette of the range.
Besides, if there was to be trouble it would rest
more comfortably on a full stomach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a quit-claim to that pan, yu coyote,&#8221;
he said pleasantly to Jim. &#8220;Yu ain&#8217;t taking no
bath!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blub&#8211;no I ain&#8217;t&#8211;blub blub&#8211;but you will
be&#8211;blub&#8211;if yu don&#8217;t lemme alone,&#8221; came from
the pan. &#8220;Hand me that towel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wallow in it, yu!&#8221; admonished Bud as
he refilled the basin. &#8220;Leave some dry spots for
me, this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim carefully hung the towel on a peg in the
wall of the house and then noticed the stranger,
who was removing his saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy, stranger!&#8221; he said heartily. &#8220;Just
in time to feed. Coax some of that water from
Bud, but get holt of the towel first, for there won&#8217;t
be none left soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan laughed and dusted his chaps.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>&#8220;Where&#8217;ll I find Lee Lung?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Blake wants him to rustle the grub lively.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the cook shack behind the house
a-doing it and trying to sing,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;He&#8217;s
always trying to sing; it goes something like this:
Hop-lee, low-hop yum-see,&#8221; he hummed in a
monotonous wail as he combed his hair before a
broken bit of mirror stuck in a crack. &#8220;Hi-dee,
hee-hee, chop-chop<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme that comb, yu heathen Chinee,&#8221; cried
Bud, &#8220;and don&#8217;t make that noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else yu wants?&#8221; asked Jim, deliberately
putting the comb away in the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be in Kansas City with a million
dollars and a whopper of a thirst,&#8221; replied Bud as
he filled the basin for the stranger. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
yourn, stranger. Grub&#8217;s waiting for yu inside when
yore ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do yu know who that feller is?&#8221; Bud asked
in a whisper as they made their way to the table,
from which came much laughter. &#8220;That&#8217;s The
Orphant,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; h&#8211;l it is!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Him? Him
Th&#8217; Orphant? Tell another! I&#8217;m more than six
years old, even if yu ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight, fellers!&#8221; said Bud to the
assembled outfit in a low voice. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t kidding
yu none, honest. I saw him up to Ace High last
year. That&#8217;s him, all right. Wait &#8217;til he comes
in and see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care if he&#8217;s Jonah,&#8221; responded
Jim. &#8220;Only I reckons you&#8217;re plumb loco, all the
same. But I&#8217;m too hungry to care if Gabriel
blows if I can fill up before these Oliver Twists
eats it all up,&#8221; he said, revealing his last reading
matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shore enough wears his gun plumb low&#8211;and
the holster is tied to his chaps, too,&#8221; muttered
Jim as he seated himself at the table. &#8220;So would
I, too, if I was him. Pass them murphys, Humble,&#8221;
he ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You has got to bust that piebald pet what
you&#8217;ve been keeping around the house to-morrow,
Humble,&#8221; exulted the man nearest to him. &#8220;And
it&#8217;ll shore be a circus watching you do it, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>The blankets which divided the bunk house into
two rooms were pushed aside and The Orphan
entered, carrying his saddle and bridle, which he
placed beside the others on the floor. Then he
unbuckled his belts and hung them, Colts and all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
over the pommel, which was etiquette and which
gave assurance that the guest was not hunting anyone.
Then he seated himself at the table in a chair
which Humble pushed back for him. His entry
in no degree caused a lull in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you hasn&#8217;t got no kick coming, has
you?&#8221; asked Humble. &#8220;Hey, Cookie!&#8221; he
shouted into the dark gallery which led to the cook
shack. &#8220;Rustle in some more fixings for another
place, and bring in the slush!&#8221; Then he turned
to his tormentor: &#8220;You has allus got something
to say about my business, ain&#8217;t you, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sic &#8217;em, Humble!&#8221; said Silent Allen. &#8220;Go
for him!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the gallery came sounds of calamity and
then a mongrel dog shot out and collided with the
table, glancing off it and under the curtain in his
haste to gain the outside world. A second later
the cook, his face fiendish, grasping a huge knife,
followed the dog out on the plain. Those eating
sprang to their feet and streamed after the cook,
yelling encouragement to their favorite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go it, Old Woman!&#8221; &#8220;&#8217;Ray for Cookie!&#8221;
&#8220;Beat him out, Lightning!&#8221; and other expressions
met Blake as he came up from the corral.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>&#8220;Cook got &#8217;em again?&#8221; he asked, elbowing his
way into the house. &#8220;I told you to keep liquor
away from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t liquor this time; it&#8217;s th&#8217; kioodle,&#8221; replied
Docile Thomas as he led the way back to the
table. &#8220;Him an&#8217; th&#8217; dog don&#8217;t mix extra well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake swept aside the blanket and saw The
Orphan standing by the window and laughing.
Turning, he disappeared into the gallery and soon
returned with a tin plate, a steel knife, a tin cup
and the coffee pot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down&#8211;good Lord, they would let a man
starve,&#8221; he said, roughly clearing a place at the
table for the new arrival. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how
you feel,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but I&#8217;m so all-fired hungry
that I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s my back or
stomach that hurts. Take some beef and throw
those potatoes down this way. Here, have some
slush,&#8221; filling The Orphan&#8217;s cup with coffee.
&#8220;This ain&#8217;t like the coffee the sheriff drinks, but it
is just a little bit better than nothing. You see,
Cook&#8217;s all right, only he can&#8217;t cook, never could
and never will. But he&#8217;s a whole lot better than
a sailor I once suffered under.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter between you and Lightning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
Lee?&#8221; asked Bud as the cook passed by the
table on his way to the shack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he drink yore slush? I allus said
some dogs was smart,&#8221; laughed Jack Lawson.</p>

<p>Lee&#8217;s smile was bland. &#8220;Scalpee th&#8217; dlog,&#8221; he
asserted as he disappeared. &#8220;No dlamn good!&#8221;
wafted from the gallery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Humble,&#8221; said Silent Allen in an aggrieved
tone, &#8220;the beef will wag its tail some night
if you don&#8217;t shoot that cur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; endorsed Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot
him for a dollar,&#8221; he added hopefully. &#8220;The
boys will all chip in to make up the purse and it
won&#8217;t cost you a cent, not even a cartridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody that don&#8217;t like that setter can
move,&#8221; responded Humble with decision. &#8220;He&#8217;s
a O. K. dog, that&#8217;s what he is,&#8221; he added loyally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a setter, all right,&#8221; laughed Silent.
&#8220;He ain&#8217;t good for nothing else but to set around
all day in the shade and chew hisself up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; cried Humble, delaying
the morsel on his fork in mid-air. &#8220;You ought
to see him a-chasing coyotes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did see him chasing coyotes, and that&#8217;s why
I want you to have him killed,&#8221; replied Silent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
grinning. &#8220;His feet are too big. Every time he
shoves his hind feet between the front ones he
throws hisself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he ever catch except fleas and the
mange?&#8221; asked Blake, winking at The Orphan,
who was extremely busy burying his hunger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he ever catch!&#8221; indignantly cried
Humble, dropping his fork. &#8220;You saw him catch
that gray wolf over near the timber, and you can&#8217;t
deny it, neither!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George, he did!&#8221; exclaimed Blake seriously.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right this time, Humble, he did.
But he let go awful sudden. Besides, that gray
wolf you&#8217;re talking about was a coyote, and he
would have died of old age in another week if you
hadn&#8217;t shot him to save the dog. And, what&#8217;s
more, I never saw him chase anything since, not
even rabbits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He caught my boot one night,&#8221; remarked
Charley Bailey, reflectively, &#8220;right plumb on his
near eye. Oh, he&#8217;s a catcher, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so good he ought to be stuffed, then he
could sit without having to move around catching
boots and things,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
have him stuffed, Humble?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>&#8220;Oh, yore a whole lot smart, now ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;
blazed the persecuted puncher, glaring at his tormentors.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t catch his tail, Silent,&#8221; offered Bud.
&#8220;I once saw him trying to do it for ten minutes&#8211;he
looked like a pinwheel what we used to have
when we were kids. Missed it every time, and all
he got was a cheap drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Humble said a few things which came out so
fast that they jammed up, and he left the room to
hunt for his dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any particular reason why you call him Lightning,
or is it just irony?&#8221; asked The Orphan as he
helped himself to the beef for the third time. &#8220;I
never heard that name used before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t irony at all!&#8221; hastily denied the
foreman. &#8220;That&#8217;s a real good name, fits him
all right,&#8221; he assured. Then he explained: &#8220;You
see, lightning don&#8217;t hit twice in the same place, and
neither can the dog when he scratches himself.
And, besides, he can dodge awful quick. You
have to figure which way he&#8217;ll jump when you
want him to catch anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t have to remember his name at
all, Stranger,&#8221; interposed Silent, who was not at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
all silent. &#8220;Any handle will do, if you only yells.
Every time anybody yells he makes a crow line for
the plain and howls at every jump. He&#8217;s got a
regular, shore enough trail worn where he makes
his get-away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence descended over the table, and for a quarter
of an hour only the click of eating utensils
could be heard. At the end of that time Blake
pushed back his chair and arose. He glanced
around the table and then spoke very distinctly:
&#8220;Well, Orphan, get acquainted with your outfit.&#8221;
A head or two raised at the name, but that seemed
to be all the effect of his words. &#8220;The boys will
put you onto the game in the morning, and Bud
will show you where to begin in case I don&#8217;t show
up in time. Better take a fresh cayuse and let yours
rest up some. Don&#8217;t hurt Humble&#8217;s ki-yi and
he&#8217;ll be plumb nice to you; and if Silent wants to
know how you likes his singing and banjo playing,
lie and say it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The laugh went around and all was serene with
the good fellowship which is so often found in
good outfits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, I&#8217;ll bring the mail out with me, so you
needn&#8217;t go after it,&#8221; continued the foreman as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
strode towards the door. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going
over for,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, I&#8217;d go, too, if pie and cake and good
coffee was on the card,&#8221; laughed Silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll shore have to go over in a gang some
night and raid that pantry,&#8221; remarked Bud. &#8220;It
would be a circus, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sheriff would get some good target practice,
that&#8217;s shore,&#8221; responded Blake. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve
got something better than that, and since you
brought the subject up I&#8217;ll tell you now, so you&#8217;ll
be good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Shields has promised to get up a fine feed
for you fellows as soon as Jim&#8217;s sisters are on hand
to help her, and as they are here now I wouldn&#8217;t
be a whole lot surprised if I brought the invitation
back with me. How&#8217;s that for a change, eh?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; cried Silent. &#8220;Hurry up and get
home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, she&#8217;s all right, ain&#8217;t she!&#8221; shouted Jack,
executing a jig to show how glad he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pinch me, Humble, pinch me!&#8221; begged Bud.
&#8220;I may be asleep and dreaming&#8211;<i>here!</i> What the
devil do you think I am, you wart-headed coyote!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
he yelled, dancing in pain and rubbing his leg
frantically. &#8220;You blamed doodle bug, yu!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I pinched you, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; indignantly
cried Humble. &#8220;What&#8217;s eating you? Didn&#8217;t you
ask me to, you chump?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up and get that mail, Tom,&#8221; cried Jim.
&#8220;It might spoil&#8211;and say, if she leads at you with
that invite, clinch!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake laughed and went off toward the corral.
As he found the horse he wished to ride he heard
a riot in the bunk-house and he laughed silently.
A Virginia reel was in full swing and the noise was
terrible. Riding past the window, he saw Silent
working like a madman at his banjo; and assiduously
playing a harmonica was The Orphan, all
smiles and puffed-out cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, The Orphan is all right now,&#8221; the foreman
muttered as he swung out on the trail to
Ford&#8217;s Station. &#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s found himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the bunk-house there was much hilarity, and
laughter roared continually at the grotesque gymnastics
of the reel and at the sharp wit which cut
right and left, respecting no one save the new member
of the outfit, and eventually he came in for his
share, which he repaid with interest. Suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
Jim, catching his spurs in a bear-skin rug which
lay near a bunk, threw out his arms to save himself
and then went sprawling to the floor. The
uproar increased suddenly, and as it died down
Jim could be heard complaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span> <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!&#8221; he cried as he nursed his knee.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had that pelt for nigh onto three years and
regularly I go and get tangled up with it. It shore
beats all how I plumb forget its habit of wrapping
itself around them rowels, what are too big, anyhow.
And it ain&#8217;t a big one at that, only about
half as big as the one I got for a tenderfoot up in
Montanny,&#8221; he deprecated in disgust.</p>

<p>The outfit scented a story and became suddenly
quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dod-blasted postage stamp of a pelt,&#8221; he
grumbled as he threw it into his bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other skin couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been much bigger
than that one,&#8221; said Bud, leading him on. &#8220;How
big was it, anyhow, Jim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t, hey? It came off a nine-foot
grizzly, that&#8217;s how big it was,&#8221; retorted Jim, sitting
down and filling his pipe. &#8220;Nine whole feet
from stub of tail to snoot, plumb full of cussedness,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>&#8220;How&#8217;d you get it&#8211;Sharps?&#8221; queried Charley.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Colt,&#8221; responded Jim. &#8220;Luckiest shot <i>I</i>
ever made, all right. I shore had visions of wearing
wings when I pulled the trigger. Just one of
them lucky shots a man will make sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us the story, Jim,&#8221; suggested Silent, settling
himself easily in his bunk. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have
another smoke and go right to bed. I&#8217;m some
sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Jim after his pipe was going
well, &#8220;I was sort of second foreman for the Tadpole,
up in Montanny, about six years ago. I had
a good foreman, a good ranch and about a dozen
white punchers to look after. And we had a real
cook, no mistake about that, all right.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Old Man hibernated in New York during
the winter and came out every spring right after
the calf round-up was over to see how we was fixed
and to eat some of the cook&#8217;s flapjacks. That cook
wasn&#8217;t no yaller-skinned post for a hair clothes line,
like this grinning monkey what we&#8217;ve got here.
The Old Man was a fine old cuss&#8211;one of the boys,
and a darn good one, too&#8211;and we was always
plumb glad to see him. He minded his own business,
didn&#8217;t tell us how we ought to punch cows and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
didn&#8217;t bother anybody what didn&#8217;t want to be
bothered, which we most of us did like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one day Jed Thompson, who rustled
our mail for us twice a month, handed me a letter
for the foreman, who was down South and
wouldn&#8217;t be back for some time. His mother had
died and he went back home for a spell. I saw
that the letter was from the Old Man, and wondered
what it would say. I sort of figured that it
would tell us when to hitch up to the buckboard
and go after him. Fearing that he might land
before the foreman got back, I went and opened
it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was from the Old Man, all right, but it was
no go for him that spring. He was sick abed in
New York, and said as how he was plumb sorry
he couldn&#8217;t get out to see his boys, and so was we
sorry. But he said as how he was sending us a
friend of his&#8217;n who wanted to go hunting, and
would we see that he didn&#8217;t shoot no cows. We
said we would, and then I went on and found out
when this hunter was due to land.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the unfortunate day rolled around I
straddled the buckboard and lit out for Whisky
Crossing, twenty miles to the east, it being the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
nearest burg on the stage line. And as I pulled in
I saw Frank, who drove the stage, and he was
grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I reckon that&#8217;s your&#8217;n,&#8217; he said, pointing to a
circus clown what had got loose and was sizing up
the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The drinks are on me when I sees you again,
Frank,&#8217; I said, for somehow I felt that he was
right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I sized up my present, and blamed if he
wasn&#8217;t all rigged out to kill Indians. While my
mouth was closing he ambled up to me and stared
at my gun, which must &#8217;a&#8217; been purty big to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you Mr. Fisher&#8217;s hired man?&#8217; he asked,
giving me a real tolerating look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frank followed his grin into the saloon, leaving
the door open so he could hear everything.
That made me plumb sore at Frank, him a-doing
a thing like that, and I glared.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I ain&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s hired man, and never was,&#8217;
I said, sort of riled. &#8216;We ain&#8217;t had no hired man
since we lynched the last one, but I&#8217;m next door to
the foreman. Won&#8217;t I do, or do you insist on
talking to a hired man? If you do, he&#8217;s in the
saloon.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, yes, you&#8217;ll do!&#8217; he said, quick-like, and
then he ups and climbs aboard and we pulled out
for home, Frank waving his sombrero at me and
laughing fit to kill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t no more than got started when the
hunter ups and grabs at the lines, which he shore
missed by a foot. I was driving them cayuses, not
him, and I told him so, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But ain&#8217;t you going to take my luggage?&#8217; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Luggage! What luggage?&#8217; I answers, surprised-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he pointed behind him, and blamed if
he didn&#8217;t have two trunks, a gripsack and three
gun cases. I didn&#8217;t say a word, being too full of
cuss words to let any of &#8217;em loose, until Frank
wobbled up and asked me if I&#8217;d forgot something.
Then I shore said a few, after which I busted my
back a-hoisting his freight cars aboard, and we
started out again, Frank acting like a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n fool.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cayuses raised their ears, wondering what
we was taking the saloon for, and I reckoned we
would make them twenty miles in about eight hours
if nothing busted and we rustled real hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, about every twenty minutes I had to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
off and hoist some of his furniture aboard, it being
jolted off, for the prairie wasn&#8217;t paved a whole lot,
and us going cross-country. Considering my back,
and the fact that he kept calling me &#8216;My
man,&#8217; and Frank&#8217;s grin, I wasn&#8217;t in no frame of
mind to lead a religion round-up when I got home
and dumped Davy Crockett&#8217;s war-duds overboard
for Jed to rustle in. I was still sore at Jed for
bringing that letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davy Crockett dusted for the house and
ordered Sammy Johns to oil his guns and put them
together, after which he went off a-poking his nose
into everything in sight, and mostly everything that
wasn&#8217;t in sight. When he got back to the house
from his tour of inspection he found his guns just
like he&#8217;d left them, and that was in their cases.
Then he ambled out to me and registered his howl.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My man,&#8217; he said, &#8216;My man, that hired man
what I told to put my guns together ain&#8217;t done it!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, he didn&#8217;t?&#8217; I said, hanging on to my
cuss words, for I was some surprised and couldn&#8217;t
say a whole lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, he hasn&#8217;t, and so I&#8217;ve come out to report
him,&#8217; he said, looking mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My man!&#8217; said I, mad some myself, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
looking him plumb in the eyes. &#8216;My man, if he
had I&#8217;d shore think he was off his feed or loco. He
ain&#8217;t no hired man, but he is a all-fired good cow-puncher,
and I&#8217;m a heap scared about him not filling
you full of holes, you asking him to do a thing
like that! He must be real sick.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have no come-back to that, but just
looked sort of funny, and then he trotted off to put
his guns together hisself. I hustled around and
saw that some work was done right and then went
in to supper. After it was over my present got up
and handed me a gun, and I near fell over. It
was a purty little Winchester, and I don&#8217;t blame
him a whole lot for being tickled over it, for it
shore was a beauty, but it oozed out a ball about
the size of a pea, and the makers would &#8217;a&#8217; been
some scared if they had known it was running
around loose in a grizzly-bear country.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I reckon that&#8217;ll stop him,&#8217; he said, happy-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop what?&#8217; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, game&#8211;bears, of course,&#8217; he said,
shocked at my appalling ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I, slow-like, &#8216;I reckon Ephraim
may turn around and scratch hisself, if you hits
him.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>&#8220;&#8216;Why, won&#8217;t that stop a bear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, if it&#8217;s a stuffed bear,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, that&#8217;s a blamed good rifle!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It shore is; it&#8217;s as fine a gun as I ever laid my
eyes on,&#8217; I replied, &#8216;for prairie dogs and such.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I felt plumb sorry for him, he being so
ignorant, and so when he hands me a peach of a
shotgun to shoot coyotes with I laid it down and
got my breach-loading Sharps, .50 caliber, which
I handed to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There,&#8217; I said, &#8216;that&#8217;s the only gun in the
room what any self-respecting bear will give a
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n for.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looked at it, felt its heft, sized up the bunghole
and then squinted along the sights.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, this gun will kick like the very deuce!&#8217;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kick!&#8217; said I. &#8217;<span class='sc'>Kick</span>! She&#8217;ll kick like a
army mule if you holds her far enough from your
shoulder. But I&#8217;d a whole lot ruther get kicked
by a mule than hugged by a grizzly, and so&#8217;ll you
when you sees him a-heading your way.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But what&#8217;ll you use?&#8217; says he, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want
to take your gun.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when he said that I reckoned that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
had some good stuff in him after all, and somehow
I felt better. There he was, away from his mother
and sisters, among a bunch of gamboling cow-punchers,
and right in the middle of a good bear
country. I sort of wondered if he was to blame,
and managed to lay all the fault on his city
bringing-up.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s all right,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take an old
muzzle-loading Bridesburg what&#8217;s been laying
around the house ever since I came here. It
heaves enough lead at one crack to sink a man-of-war,
being a .60 caliber.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, bright and early the next morning we
started out for bear, and I knowed just where to
look, too. You see, there was a thicket of berry
bushes about three miles from the ranch house and
I had seen plenty of tracks there, and there was a
grizzly among them, too, and as big as a house,
judging from the signs. The boys had wanted to
ride out in a gang and rope him, but I said as how
I was saving him for a dude hunter to practice on,
so they left him alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;We footed it through the brush, and finally
Davy Crockett, who simply would go ahead of me,
yelled out that he had found tracks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>&#8220;I rustled over, and sure enough he had, only
they wasn&#8217;t made by no bear, and I said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then what are they?&#8217; he asked, sort of disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cow tracks,&#8217; said I. &#8216;When you see bear
tracks you&#8217;ll know it right away,&#8217; and we went on
a-hunting.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had just got down in a little hollow, where
the green flies were purty bad, when I saw tracks,
and they was bear tracks this time, and whoppers.
It had rained a little during the night and the
ground was just soft enough to show them nice.
I called Davy Crockett and he came up, and when
he saw them tracks he was plumb tickled, and some
scairt.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where is he?&#8217; he asked, looking around sort
of anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;At the front end of these tracks, making
more,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And what are we going to do now?&#8217; he
asked, cocking the Sharps.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;re going to trail him,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and if we
finds him and has any accidents, you wants to telegraph
yourself up a tree, and be sure that it ain&#8217;t
a big tree, too.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>&#8220;&#8217;&#8221;Be sure it ain&#8217;t a big tree!&#8220;&#8217; he repeated,
looking at me like he thought I wanted him to get
killed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Exactly,&#8217; said I, and then I explained: &#8216;The
bigger the tree, the sooner you&#8217;ll be a meal, for he
climbs by hugging the trunk and pushing hisself
up. A little tree&#8217;ll slide through his legs, and he
can&#8217;t get a holt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I hope I don&#8217;t forget that!&#8217; he exclaimed,
looking dubious.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The less you forgets when bear hunting,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;the longer you&#8217;ll remember.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We took up the trail and purty soon we saw
the bear, and he was so big he didn&#8217;t hardly know
how to act. He was pawing berries into his mouth
for breakfast, and he turned his head and slowly
sized us up. He dropped on all fours and then
got up again, and Davy Crockett, not listening to
me telling him where to shoot, lets drive and busted
an ear. Ephraim preferred all fours again and
started coming straight at us, and Moses and all
his bullrushers couldn&#8217;t have stopped him. He was
due to arrive near Davy Crockett in about four
and a half seconds, and that person dropped his
gun and hot-footed it for a whopping big tree. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
yelled at him and told him to take a little one, but
he was too blamed busy hunting bear to listen to a
no-account hired man like me, so he kept on a-going
for the big tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;I figured, and figured blamed quick, that the
bear would tag him just about the time he tagged
the tree, and so, hoping to create a diversion, I
whanged away at the bear&#8217;s tail, him running
plumb away from me. I was real successful, for
I created it all right. When he felt that carload
of lead slide up under his skin he braced hisself,
slid and wheeled, looking for the son-of-a-gun what
done it, and he saw me pouring powder hell-bent
down my gun. He must &#8217;a&#8217; knowed that I was the
real business end of the partnership, and that he&#8217;d
have trouble a-plenty if he let me finish my job, for
he came at me like a bullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Climb a <i>little</i> tree! Climb a <i>little</i> tree!&#8217;
yelled Davy Crockett from his perch in his two-foot-through
oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t in no joyous frame of mind when a
nine-foot grizzly was due in the next mail, but I
just had to laugh at his advice when I sized up his
layout. As I jumped to one side the bear slid past,
trying awful hard to stop, and he was doing real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
well, too. As he turned I slipped on some of that
green grass, and thought as how the Old Man
would have to get another puncher.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I ain&#8217;t never going to peter out with a tenderfoot
looking on if I can help it!&#8217; I said to myself,
and I jerked loose my six-shooter, shooting offhand
and some hasty. It was just a last hope, the
kick of a dying man&#8217;s foot, but it fetched him,
blamed if it didn&#8217;t! He went down in a heap and
clawed about for a spell, but I put five more in
him, and then sat down. Did you ever notice how
long it takes a grizzly to die? I loaded my gun in
a hurry, the sweat pouring down my face, for that
was one of the times it ain&#8217;t no disgrace to be some
scared, which I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is he dead?&#8217; called Davy Crockett from his
tree, hopeful-like and some anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is,&#8217; I said, &#8216;or, leastawise, he was.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Davy was a sight. He was all skinned up
from his clinch with the tree, though how he used
his face getting up is more than I can tell. And
he was some white and unsteady. He had all the
hunting he wanted, and he managed to say that he
was glad he hadn&#8217;t come out alone, and that he
reckoned I was right about his guns after all. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
we took a last look at the bear and lit out for the
ranch, where I told the boys to go out and drag
our game home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim knocked the ashes from his pipe and began
to fill it anew, acting as though the story was finished,
but Bud knew him well, and he spoke up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what then?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the hunter left for New York the very
next day, and I skinned the bear and sent the pelt
after him as a present. When I wrote out my
quarterly report, the foreman not being back yet,
I told the Old Man that if he had any more friends
what wanted to go hunting to send them up to
Frenchy McAllister on the Tin Cup. I was some
sore at Frenchy for the way he had cleaned me out
at poker.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw the skin to the floor and began to
undress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, now, lights out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
tired.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SHERIFF STATES SOME FACTS</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE foreman of the Star C impatiently tossed his bridle reins over the
post which stood near the sheriff&#8217;s door and knocked
heavily, brushing the dust of his ride from him.
Quick, heavy steps approached within the house
and the door suddenly flew open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Tom!&#8221; Shields cried, shaking hands
with his friend. &#8220;Come right in&#8211;I knew you
would come if we coaxed you a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do much coaxing&#8211;I can&#8217;t
stay away, Jim,&#8221; replied Blake with a laugh.
&#8220;How do you do, Mrs. Shields?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Tom,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Miss
Ritchie, Helen, Mary, this is Tom Blake; Tom,
Miss Ritchie and James&#8217; sisters. They are to stay
with us just as long as they can, and I&#8217;ll see that it
is a good, long time, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; he cried heartily, acknowledging
the introduction. &#8220;I am glad to meet you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
for I&#8217;ve heard a whole lot about you. I hope you&#8217;ll
like this country&#8211;greatest country under the sky!
You stay out here a month and I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll be
just like lots of people, and not want to go back
East again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems as though we have always known
Mr. Blake, for James has written about you so
much,&#8221; replied Helen, and then she laughed: &#8220;But
I am not so sure about liking this country, although
very unusual things seem to take place in it. The
journey was very trying, and it seemed to get worse
as we neared our destination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to confess that the stage-ride
part of it is a drawback, and also that Apaches
don&#8217;t make good reception committees. They are
a little too pressing at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, speaking seriously,&#8221; responded Helen, &#8220;I
have had a really delightful time. James has
managed to get me a very tame horse after quite a
long search, and I have taken many rides about the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait &#8217;til you see that horse, Tom,&#8221; laughed
the sheriff. &#8220;It&#8217;s warranted not to raise any devilment,
but it can&#8217;t, for it has all it can do to stand
up alone, and can&#8217;t very well run away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>&#8220;I see that The Orphan delivered my message,
contrary to the habits of men,&#8221; remarked the
sheriff&#8217;s wife as she took the guest&#8217;s hat and offered
him a seat. &#8220;I spoke to James about it several
days ago, and asked him to send you word when
he could, for you have not been here for a long
time. And the wonderful thing about it is that
he remembered to tell The Orphan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he replied, seating himself.
&#8220;Yes, he delivered it all right, it was about the
second thing he said. But I just couldn&#8217;t get here
any sooner, Mrs. Shields. And I was just wondering
if I could get over to-night when he told me.
When he said &#8216;apricot pie&#8217; he looked sort of sad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;You must take
him one&#8211;it was a shame to send such a message
by him, poor, lonesome boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he ain&#8217;t so lonesome now,&#8221; laughed
Blake.</p>

<p>Helen had looked up quickly at the mention of
The Orphan&#8217;s name, and the sheriff replied to her
look of inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent him out to punch for Blake, Helen,&#8221; he
said quickly. &#8220;If he has the right spirit in him
he&#8217;ll get along with the Star C outfit; if he hasn&#8217;t,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
why, he won&#8217;t get on with anybody. But I reckon
Tom will bring out all the good in him; he&#8217;ll have
a fair show, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you never told us about it!&#8221; cried Helen
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was saving it up,&#8221; laughed the sheriff.
&#8220;What do you think of him, Tom?&#8221; he asked,
turning to the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s a clean-looking boy,&#8221; answered
Blake. &#8220;I like his looks. He seems to be a fellow
what can be depended on in a pinch, and after all
I had heard about him he sort of took me by surprise.
I thought he would be a tough-looking
killer, and there he was only a overgrown, mischievous
kid. But there is a look in his eyes that
says there is a limit. But he surprised me, all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to appreciate that, Miss Ritchie,&#8221;
remarked the sheriff, smiling broadly. &#8220;Anything
that takes Tom Blake by surprise must have merit
of some kind. And he is a good judge of men,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do so hope he gets on well,&#8221; she replied
earnestly. &#8220;He was a perfect gentleman when he
was here, and his wit was sharp, too. And out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
there on that awful plain, when he stood swaying
with weakness, he looked just splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pure grit, pure grit!&#8221; cried the sheriff in reply.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m banking on him,&#8221; he added, his
eyes warming as he remembered. &#8220;Any fellow
who could turn a trick like that, and who has so
much clean-cut courage, must be worth looking
after. He&#8217;s got a bad reputation, but he&#8217;s plumb
white and square with me, and I&#8217;m going to be
square with him. And when you know all that I
know about him you&#8217;ll take his reputation as a
natural result of hard luck, spunk, and other people&#8217;s
devilment and foolishness. But he&#8217;s going
to have a show now, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did your men say when they saw him?
Do they know who he is?&#8221; asked Mrs. Shields
anxiously.</p>

<p>Blake laughed: &#8220;Oh, yes, they know who he is.
They ain&#8217;t the talking kind in a case like that; they
won&#8217;t say a word to him about what he has done.
Besides, he was under their roof, eating their food,
and that&#8217;s enough for them. Of course, they were
a little surprised, but not half as much as I thought
they would be. He is a man who gives a good
first impression, and the boys are all fine fellows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
big-hearted, square, clean-living and peaceful.
Reputations don&#8217;t count for much with them, for
they know that reputations are gossip-made in most
cases. I asked him to stay, and they haven&#8217;t got
no reason to object, and they won&#8217;t waste no time
looking for reasons, neither. If there is any trouble
at all, it will be his own fault. Then again,
they know that he is all sand and that his gunplay
is real and sudden; not that they are afraid of him,
or anybody else, for that matter, but he is the kind
of a man they like&#8211;somebody who can stand up
on his own legs and give better than he gets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon he fills that bill, all right,&#8221; laughed
the sheriff. &#8220;He <i>can</i> stand up on his own legs,
and when he does he makes good. And as for gunplay,
good Lord, he&#8217;s a shore wizard! I reckoned
I could do things with a gun, but he can beat me.
He ain&#8217;t no Boston pet, and he ain&#8217;t no city tough,
not nohow. And I&#8217;d rather have him with me in
a mix-up than against me. He&#8217;s the coolest proposition
loose in this part of the country at any game,
and I know what I&#8217;m talking about, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You promised to tell us everything about him,
all you knew,&#8221; reproached Helen. &#8220;And I am
sure that it will be well worth hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>&#8220;Well, I was saving it up &#8217;til I could tell it all
at once and when you would all be together,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any use of telling it
twice,&#8221; he explained as he brought out a box of
cigars. &#8220;These are the same brand you sampled
last time you were here,&#8221; he assured his friend as
he extended the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George, that&#8217;s fine!&#8221; cried the foreman,
picking out the blackest cigar he could see. &#8220;I
could taste them cigars for a whole week, they was
so good. There&#8217;s nothing like a good Perfecto to
make a fellow feel like he&#8217;s too lucky to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mrs. Shields. &#8220;Then you won&#8217;t
care for the coffee and pie and gingerbread,&#8221; she
sighed. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake jumped: &#8220;Lord, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he cried hastily,
&#8220;I meant in the smoking line! Why, I&#8217;ve
been losing sleep a-dreaming of your cooking.
Every time the cook fills my cup with his insult to
coffee I feel so lonesome that it hurts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to look out, Tom!&#8221; laughingly
warned the sheriff, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll get yourself disliked!
When I don&#8217;t care for Margaret&#8217;s cooking I ain&#8217;t
fool enough to say so, not a bit of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice one to talk like that!&#8221; cried his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
wife. &#8220;You are just like a little boy on baking
day&#8211;I can hardly keep you out of the kitchen.
You bother me to death, and it is all I can do to
cook enough for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>After the laugh had subsided and a steaming cup
of coffee had been placed at the foreman&#8217;s elbow,
Helen impatiently urged her brother to begin his
story.</p>

<p>He lighted his cigar with exasperating deliberateness
and then laughed softly: &#8220;Gosh! I&#8217;m getting
to be a second fiddle around here. From
morning to night all I hear is The Orphan. The
first thing that hits me when I come home is, &#8216;Have
you seen The Orphan?&#8217; or, &#8216;Have you heard anything
about him?&#8217; The worst offenders are Miss
Ritchie and Helen. They pester me nigh to death
about him. But here goes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;d better begin with Old John Taylor,&#8221;
he slowly began. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing some
quiet hunting lately, and in the course of it I ran
across Old John down in Crockettsville. You
remember him, don&#8217;t you, Tom? Yes, I reckoned
you wouldn&#8217;t forget the man who got us out of
that Apache scrape. Well, I had a good talk with
him, and this is what I learned:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>&#8220;About twenty years ago a family named Gordon
moved into northwestern Texas and put up a
shack in one of the valleys. There was three of
them, father, mother, and a bright little five-year-old
boy, and they brought about two hundred head
of cattle, a few horses and a whole raft of books.
Gordon bought up quite a bit of land from a ranch
nearby at almost a song, and he never thought of
asking for a deed&#8211;who would, down there in
those days? There wasn&#8217;t a rancher who owned
more than a quarter section; you know the game,
Tom&#8211;take up a hundred and sixty acres on a
stream and then claim about a million, and fight
like the very devil to hold it. We&#8217;ve all done it, I
reckon, but there is plenty of land for everybody,
and so there is no kick. Well, he was shore lucky,
for his boundary on two sides was a fair-sized
stream that never went dry, and you know how
scarce that is&#8211;a whole lot better than a gold mine
to a cattleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;They got along all right for a while, had a
tenderfoot&#8217;s luck with their cattle, which soon
began to be more than a few specks on the plain,
and he was very well satisfied with everything,
except that there wasn&#8217;t no school. Old man Gordon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
was daffy on education, which is a good thing
to be daffy over, and he was some strong in that
line himself, having been a school teacher back
East. But he took his boy in hand and taught him
all he knew, which must have been a whole lot,
judging from things in general, and the kid was a
smart, quick youngster. He was plumb crazy
about two things&#8211;books and guns. He read and
re-read all the books he could borrow, and got so
he could handle a gun with any man on the range.</p>

<p>&#8220;About five years after he had located, the
ranchman from whom he bought his range and
water rights went and died. Some of the heirs,
who were not what you would call square, began
to get an itching for Gordon&#8217;s land, which was
improved by the first irrigation ditch in Texas.
There was a garden and a purty good orchard,
which was just beginning to bear fruit. It was
pure, cussed hoggishness, for there was more land
than anybody had any use for, but they must grab
everything in sight, no matter what the cost.
Trouble was the rule after that, and the old man
was up against it all the time. But he managed to
hold his own, even though he did lose a lot of
cattle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>&#8220;His brand was a gridiron, which wasn&#8217;t much
different from the gridiron circle brand of the big
ranch. It ain&#8217;t much trouble to use a running iron
through a wet blanket and change a brand like that
when you know how, and the Gridiron Circle gang
shore enough knew how. Their expertness with a
running iron would have caused questions to be
asked, and probably a lynching bee, in other parts
of the country, but down there they were purty
well alone. They let Gordon know that he had
jumped the range, which was just what they had
done, that he didn&#8217;t own it, and that the sooner he
left the country the better it would be for his
health. But he had peculiar ideas about justice,
and he shore was plumb full of grit and obstinacy.
He knew he was right, that he had paid for the
land, and that he had improved it. And he had a
lot of faith in the law, not realizing that he hadn&#8217;t
anything to show the law. And he didn&#8217;t know
that law and justice don&#8217;t always mean the same
thing, not by a long shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one day he went out looking for a vein
of coal, which he thought ought to be thereabouts,
according to his books, and it ought to be close to
the surface of a fissure. He reckoned that coal of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
any quality would be some better than chips and
the little wood he owned, so he got busy. But he
didn&#8217;t find coal, but something that made him hotfoot
it to his books. When the report came back
from the assay office he knew that he had hit on a
vein of native silver, which was some better than
coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t take long for the news to get around,
though God Himself only knows how it did, unless
the storekeeper told that a package had gone
through his hands addressed to the assay office, and
things began to happen in chunks. He caught
three Gridiron Circle punchers shooting his cows,
and he was naturally mad about it and just shot up
the bunch before they knew he was around. He
killed one and spoiled the health of the other two
for some time to come, which naturally spelled war
with a big W. Then about this time his wife went
and died, which was a purty big addition to his
troubles. As he stood above her grave, all broken
up, and about ready to give up the fight and go
back East, he was shot at from cover. He didn&#8217;t
much care if he was killed or not, until he remembered
that he had a boy to take care of. Then he
got fighting mad all at once, all of his troubles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
coming up before him in a bunch, and he got his
gun and went hunting, which was only right and
proper under the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff flecked the ashes of his cigar into a
blue flower pot which was gay with white ribbons,
and poured himself a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to think that it is possible to find a whole
ranch of hellions from the owner down,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;but the nature of the owner picks a dirty
foreman, and a dirty foreman needs dirty men, and
there you are. That fits the case of the Gridiron
Circle to a T. There was not one white man in
the whole gang,&#8221; and he sat in silence for a space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the boy, who was about fifteen years old
by this time, took his gun and went out to find his
daddy, and he succeeded. He cut him down and
buried him and then went home. That night the
shack burned to the ground, the orchard was ruined
and the boy disappeared. Some people said that
the kid took what he wanted and burned the house
rather than to have it profaned as a range house
by the curs who murdered his dad; and some said
the other thing, but from what I know of the kid,
I reckon he did it himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right there and then things began to happen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
that hurt the ease and safety of the Gridiron Circle.
Cows were found dead all over the range&#8211;juglars
cut in every case. Three of their punchers were
found dead in one week&#8211;a .5O-caliber Sharps had
done it. A regular reign of terror began and kept
the outfit on the nervous jump all the time. They
searched and trailed and searched and swore, and
if one of them went off by himself he was usually
ready to be buried. Ten experienced, old-time
cowmen were made fools of by a fifteen-year-old
kid, who was never seen by anybody that lived long
enough to tell about it. When he got hungry, he
just killed another cow and had a porterhouse steak
cooked between two others over a good fire. He
ate the middle steak, which had all the juices of the
two burned ones, and threw the others away. Three
meals a day for six months, and one cow to a meal,
was the order of things on the ranges of the Gridiron
Circle. He had plenty of ammunition, because
every dead puncher was minus his belt when
found and his guns were broken or gone; and early
in the game the boy had made a master stroke: he
raided the storehouse of the ranch one night and
lugged away about five hundred rounds of ammunition
in his saddle bags, with a couple of spare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
Colts and a repeating Winchester of the latest
pattern, and he spoiled all the rest of the guns he
could lay his hands on. Humorous kid, wasn&#8217;t he,
shooting up the ranch with its own guns and
cartridges?</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, however, after the news had spread,
which it did real quick, a regular lynching party
was arranged, and the U-B, which lay about sixty
miles to the east, sent over half a dozen men to
take a hand. Then the Gridiron Circle had a rest,
but while the gang was hunting for him and laying
all sorts of elaborate traps to catch him, the boy
was over on the U-B, showing it how foolish it had
been to take up another man&#8217;s quarrel. By this
time the whole country knew about it, and even
some Eastern papers began to give it much attention.
One of the punchers of the Gridiron Circle,
when he found a friend dead and saw the tracks
of the kid in the sand, swore and cried that it was
&#8216;that d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n Orphan&#8217; who had done it, and the
name stuck. He had become an outlaw and was
legitimate prey for any man who had the chance
and grit to turn the trick. For ten years he has
been wandering all over the range like a hunted
gray wolf, fighting for his life at every turn against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
all kinds of odds, both human and natural. And
I reckon that explains why he is accused of doing
so much killing. He has been hunted and forced
to shoot to save his own life, and a gray wolf is a
fighter when cornered. I know that I wouldn&#8217;t
give up the ghost if I could help it, and neither
would anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is a shame, an awful shame!&#8221; cried
Helen, tears of sympathy in her eyes. &#8220;How
could they do it? I don&#8217;t blame him, not a bit!
He did right, terrible as it was! And only a boy
when they began, too! Oh, it is awful, almost
unbelievable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is, Sis,&#8221; replied Shields earnestly. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t his fault, not by any manner or means&#8211;he
was warped.&#8221; And then he added slowly: &#8220;But
Tom and I will straighten him out, and if some
folks hereabouts don&#8217;t like it, they can shore lump
it, or fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me how you met him, Jim,&#8221; requested
Blake in the interval of silence. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard some
of it, second-handed, or third-handed, but I&#8217;d like
to have it straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the sheriff continued, &#8220;when he came
to these parts I didn&#8217;t know anything about him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
except what I had heard, which was only bad.
He had a nasty way of handling his gun, a hair-trigger
and a nervous finger on his gun, and he
had a distressing way of using one cow to a meal,
so I got busy. I didn&#8217;t expect much trouble in
getting him. I knew that he was only a youngster
and I counted on my fifty years, and most of them
of experience, getting him. Being young, I reckoned
he would be foolhardy and hasty and uncertain
in his wisdom; but, Lord! it was just like trying
to catch a flea in the dark. He was here,
there and everywhere. While I was down south
hunting along his trail he would be up north
objecting to the sheep industry in ingenious ways
and varying his bill of fare with choice cuts of
lamb and mutton. And by the time I got down
south he would be&#8211;God only knows where, I
didn&#8217;t. I could only guess, and I guessed wrong
until the last one. And then it was the toss of a
coin that decided it.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a while he began to get more daring,
and when I say more daring I mean an open game
with no limit. He began to prove my ideas about
his age making him reckless, though he was cautious
enough, to be sure. One day, not long ago,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
he had a run-in with two sheepmen out by the
U bend of the creek, who had driven their herds
up on Cross Bar-8 land and over the dead-line
established by the ranch. They must have taken
him for some Cross Bar-8 puncher and thought
he was going to kick up a fuss about the trespass,
or else they recognized him. Anyway, when I got
on the scene they were ready to be planted, which
I did for them. Then I went after him on a
plain trail north&#8211;and almost too plain to suit me,
because it looked like it had been made plain as an
invitation. He had picked out the softest ground
and left plenty of good tracks. But I was some
mad and didn&#8217;t care much what I run into. I
thought he had driven the whole blasted herd of
baa-baas over that high bank and into the
creek, for the number of dead sheep was shore
scandalous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I followed that cussed trail north, east, south,
west and then all over the whole United States, it
seemed to me. And it was always growing older,
because I had to waste time in dodging chaparrals
and things like that that might hold him and his
gun. I went picking my way on a roundabout
course past thickets of honey mesquite and cactus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
gardens, over alkali flats and everything else, and
the more I fooled about the madder I got. I ain&#8217;t
no real, genuine fool, and I&#8217;ve had some experience
at trailing, but I had to confess that I was
just a plain, ordinary monkey-on-a-stick when
stacked up against a kid that was only about half
my age, because suddenly the plainness of the trail
disappeared and I was left out on the middle of
a burning desert to guess the answer as best I
could. I knew what he had done, all right, but
that didn&#8217;t help me a whole lot. Did you ever
trail anybody that used padded-leather footpads
on his cayuse&#8217;s feet, and that went on a walk,
picking out the hardest ground? No? Well, I
have, and it&#8217;s no cinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got tired of chasing myself back to the same
place four times out of five, and I reckons that
it wouldn&#8217;t be very long before he had made his
circle and got me in front of him. It ain&#8217;t no
church fair to be hunting a mad devil like him
under the best conditions, and it&#8217;s a whole lot less
like one when he gets behind you doing the same
thing. I didn&#8217;t know whether he had swung to
the north or south, so I tossed up a coin and cried
heads for north&#8211;and it was tails. I cut loose at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
a lope and had been riding for some time when I
saw something through an opening in the chaparrals
to the east of me, and it moved. I swung my
glasses on it, and I&#8217;m blamed if it wasn&#8217;t an
Apache war party bound north. They were about
a mile to the east of me, and if they kept on going
straight ahead they would run across my trail in
about three hours, for it gradually worked their
way. I ducked right then and there and struck
west for a time, turning south again until I hit
the Cimarron Trail, which I followed east. Well,
as I went around one side of the chaparral six mad
Apaches went around the other, and they hit my
trail too soon to suit me. I heard a hair-raising
yell and lit out in the direction of Chattanooga as
hard as I could go, with a hungry chorus a mile
behind me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had just passed that freak bowlder on the
Apache Trail when the man I was looking for
turned up, and with the drop, of course. We
reckoned that two was needed to stop the war-paints,
which we did, him running the game and
doing most of the playing. I felt like I was his
honored guest whom he had invited to share in
the festivities. He had plenty of chances to nail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
me if he wanted to, and he had chipped in on a
game that he didn&#8217;t have to take cards in; and to
help me out. He could have let them get me and
they would have thought that I had done all the
injury and that there wasn&#8217;t another man on the
desert. But he didn&#8217;t, and I began to think he
wasn&#8217;t as bad as he was painted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told of the trouble between The
Orphan and Jimmy of the Cross Bar-8, and of the
rage which blossomed out on the ranch.</p>

<p>&#8220;That shore settled it for the Cross Bar-8.
They wanted lots of gore, and they got it, all
right, when he played five of their punchers
against the very war party he had sent north to
meet me, while I was chasing him. That war
party must have found something to their liking,
wandering about the country all that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake interrupted him: &#8220;War party that he
sent north to meet you?&#8221; he asked in surprise.
&#8220;How could he do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I said,&#8221; replied Shields, and
then he explained about the arrow. &#8220;Any man
who could stack a deck like that and use one danger
to wipe out another ain&#8217;t going to get caught
by an outfit of lunkheads&#8211;by George! if he didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
work nearly the same trick on the Cross Bar-8
crowd! Oh, it&#8217;s great, simply great!&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman slapped his knee enthusiastically:
&#8220;Fine! Fine!&#8221; he exulted. &#8220;That fellow has
got brains, plenty of them! And he&#8217;ll make use of
them to the good of this country, too, before we
get through with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields continued: &#8220;After he sic&#8217;d the chumps
of the Cross Bar-8 on the Apaches he shore raised
the devil on the ranch and I was asked to go out
and run things, which I did, or rather thought I
would do. Charley and I and the two Larkin boys
laid out on the plain all night, covered up with
sand, waiting for him to show up between us and
the windows&#8211;and the first thing I saw in the morning
was Helen&#8217;s flower pot here&#8211;it used to be Margaret&#8217;s&#8211;setting
up on top of a pile of sand under
my very nose where he had stuck it while I waited
for him&#8211;and blamed if he hadn&#8217;t signed his name
in the sand at its base!&#8221; He suddenly turned to
his sister: &#8220;Tell Tom about him calling on you
while I was waiting for him out on the ranch,
Helen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen did so and the way she told it caused the
women to look keenly at her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>Blake laughed heartily: &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t that beat
all!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t beat this,&#8221; responded the sheriff, turning
again to Helen. &#8220;Tell him about the stage
coach, Sis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know much about the first part of
it,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;All I remember is a terrible ride
&#8211;oh, it was awful!&#8221; she cried, shuddering as she
remembered the tortures of the Concord. &#8220;But
when we stopped and after I managed to get out
of the coach I saw the driver carrying a man on
his shoulders and coming toward us. He laid his
burden down and revived him&#8211;and he was a young
man, and covered with blood.&#8221; Then she paused:
&#8220;He was real nice and polite and didn&#8217;t seem to
think that he had done anything out of the ordinary.
Then we went on and he left us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff laughed and leveled an accusing finger
at her:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have left out a whole lot, Sis,&#8221; he said
affectionately. &#8220;Helen acted just like the thoroughbred
she is, Tom,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I guess
Bill told you all about it, for he&#8217;s aired it purty
well. Why, she even lost her gold pin a-helping
him!&#8221; and he grinned broadly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>Helen shot him a warning glance, but it was too
late; Mary suddenly sat bolt upright, her expression
one of shocked surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen Shields!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and I never
thought of it before! How could you do it! Why,
that horrid man will show your pin and boast about
it to everybody! The idea! I&#8217;m surprised at
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; exclaimed Shields. &#8220;I reckon that
pin is all right. He might find it handy some day
to return it, it&#8217;ll be a good excuse when he gets on
his feet. And I&#8217;d hate to be the man to laugh at
it, or try to take it from him. Now, come, Mary,
think of it right; it was the first kind act he had
known since he lost his daddy. And that pin is one
of my main stand-bys in this game. I believe that
he&#8217;ll be square as long as he has it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care, James,&#8221; warmly responded
Mary. &#8220;It was <i>not</i> a modest thing to do when she
had never seen him before, and he her brother&#8217;s
enemy and an outlaw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I have fastened the bandage, sister
dear?&#8221; asked Helen, her complexion slightly more
colored than its natural shade. &#8220;It was so very
little to do after all he had done for us!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>&#8220;Well, Tom and I have some business to talk
over, so we&#8217;ll leave you to fight the matter out
among yourselves,&#8221; the sheriff said, arising.
&#8220;Come to my room, Tom, I want to talk over that
ranch scheme with you. You bring the coffee pot
and the cigars and I&#8217;ll juggle the pie and gingerbread,&#8221;
he laughed as he led the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom!&#8221; hastily called Mrs. Shields after
good-nights had been said, and just before the
door closed; &#8220;I promised you a dinner for your
boys when Helen and Mary came, and if you think
you can spare them this coming Sunday I will have
it then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Shields,&#8221; earnestly responded
Blake, turning on the threshold. &#8220;It is awful good
of you to put yourself out that way, and you can
bet that the boys will be your devoted slaves ever
after. If you must go to that trouble, why, Sunday
or any day you may name will do for us. Gosh,
but won&#8217;t they be tickled!&#8221; he exulted as he pictured
them feasting on goodies. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be better
than a circus, it shore will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s no trouble at all, Tom,&#8221; she replied,
smiling at being able to bring cheer to a crowd of
men, lonely, as she thought. &#8220;And you will arrange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
to have The Orphan with them, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I most certainly will,&#8221; he heartily replied.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll do wonders for him.&#8221; He glanced quickly
at Helen, but she was busily engaged in threading
a needle under the lamp shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, all,&#8221; he said as he closed the door.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNDERSTANDING</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>B</span>LAKE settled himself in the easy chair which his host pushed over to
him and crossed his feet on the seat of another, and became the
personification of contentment. One of the black
Perfectos which a friend in the East kept Shields
supplied with, was tenderly nursed by his lips, its
fragrant smoke slowly issuing from his nose and
mouth, yielding its delights to a man who knew a
good cigar when he smoked it, and who knew how
to smoke it. At his elbow stood a coffee pot, flanked
on one side by a plate piled high with gingerbread;
on the other by an apricot pie. His eyes half-closed
and his arms were folded, and a great peace
stole over him. He had the philosopher&#8217;s mind
which so readily yields to the magic touch of a
perfect cigar. In that short space of time he was
recompensed for a life of hardships, perils and but
few pleasures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>They sat each lost in his own thoughts, in a
silence broken only by the very low and indistinct
hum of women&#8217;s voices and the loud ticking of the
clock, which soon struck ten. The foreman sighed,
stirred to knock the ashes from his cigar, and then
slowly reached his hand toward the pie. Shields
came to himself and very gravely relighted his cigar,
watching the blue smoke stream up over the lamp.
He looked at his contented friend for a few seconds
and then broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what I&#8217;m going to tell you
now is all meat. I couldn&#8217;t say anything about it
while the women were around, for they shore worry
a lot and there wasn&#8217;t no good in scaring them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cross Bar-8 outfit got saddled with the
idea that they wanted a new sheriff, and four of
them didn&#8217;t care a whole lot how they made the
necessary vacancy. I got word that they were going
to pay Bill Howland for the part he played, and
on the face of it there wasn&#8217;t nothing more than
that. It was natural enough that they were sore
on him, and that they would try to square matters.
Well, of course, I couldn&#8217;t let him get wiped out
and I took cards in the game. But, Lord, it wasn&#8217;t
what I reckoned it was at all. He was in for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
licking, all right, but <i>he</i> was the <i>little</i> fish&#8211;and <i>I</i>
was the <i>big</i> one.</p>

<p>&#8220;They got Bill in the defile of the Backbone and
were going to lynch him&#8211;they beat him up shameful.
He wouldn&#8217;t tell them that I was hand-in-glove
with The Orphan, which they wanted to
hear, so they tried to scare him to lie, but it was
no go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I followed Bill and, to make it short,
that is just what they had figured on. They posted
an outpost to get the drop on me when I showed
up, and he got it. Tex Williard seemed to be the
officer in charge, and he asked me questions and
suggested things that made me fighting mad inside.
But I was as cool as I could be apparently, for it
ain&#8217;t no good to lose your temper in a place like that.
I suppose they wanted me to get out on the warpath
so they could frame up some story about self-defense.
It looked bad for me, with three of them
having their guns on me, and Tex Williard had
just given me an ultimatum and had counted two,
when, d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d if The Orphan didn&#8217;t take a hand
from up on the wall of the defile. That let me get
my guns out, and the rest was easy. We let Bill
get square on the gang for the beating he had got,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
by whipping all of them to the queen&#8217;s taste. When
they got so they could stand up I told them a few
things and ordered them out of the country, and
they were blamed glad to get the chance to go, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Orphan didn&#8217;t have to mix up in that, not
at all, and it makes the third time he&#8217;s put his
head in danger to help me or mine, and he took
big chances every time. How in h&#8211;l can I help
liking him? Can I be blamed for treating him
white and square when he&#8217;s done so much for me?
He is so chock full of grit and squareness that
I&#8217;ll throw up this job rather than to go out after
him for his past deeds, and I mean it, too, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake reached for another piece of pie, held his
hand over it in uncertainty and then, changing his
mind, took gingerbread for a change.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon you&#8217;re right, Jim,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Anyhow, it don&#8217;t make a whole lot of difference
whether you are or not. You&#8217;re the sheriff of this
layout, and you&#8217;re to do what you think best, and
that&#8217;s the idea of most of the people out here, too.
If you want to experiment, that&#8217;s your business, for
you&#8217;ll be the first to get bit if you&#8217;re wrong. And
it ain&#8217;t necessary to tell you that your friends will
back you up in anything you try. Personally, I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
rather glad of what you&#8217;re doing, for I like that
man&#8217;s looks, as I said before, and he&#8217;ll be just the
kind of a puncher I want. He&#8217;s a man that&#8217;ll fight
like h&#8211;l for the man he ties up to and who
treats him square. If he ain&#8217;t, I&#8217;m getting childish
in my judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent him to you,&#8221; the sheriff continued, &#8220;because
I wanted to get him in with a good outfit and
under a man who would be fair with him. I knew
that you would give him every chance in the world.
And then Helen takes such an interest in him, being
young and sympathetic and romantic, that I wanted
to please her if I could, and I can. She&#8217;ll be very
much pleased now that I&#8217;ve given him a start in
the right direction and there ain&#8217;t nothing I can do
for her that is not going to be done. She&#8217;s a blamed
fine girl, Tom, as nice a girl as ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shore is&#8211;there ain&#8217;t no doubt about
that!&#8221; cried the foreman, and then he frowned
slightly. &#8220;But have you thought of what all this
might develop into?&#8221; he asked, leaning forward
in his earnestness. &#8220;It&#8217;s shore funny how I should
think of such a thing, for it ain&#8217;t in my line at all,
but the idea just sort of blew into my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8220;Well, Helen, being young and sympathetic and
romantic, as you said, and owing her own life and
the lives of her sister and friend, not to mention
yours, to him, might just go and fall in love with
him, and I reckon that if she did, she would stick
to him in spite of hell. He&#8217;s a blamed good-looking,
attractive fellow, full of energy and grit, somewhat
of a mystery, and women are strong on mysteries,
and he might nurse ideas about having some one to
make gingerbread and apricot pie for him; and if
he does, as shore as God made little apples, it&#8217;ll
be Helen that he&#8217;ll want. He&#8217;s never seen as pretty
a girl, she&#8217;s been kind and sympathetic with him,
and I&#8217;m willing to bet my hat that he&#8217;s lost a bit
of sleep about her already. Good Lord, what can
you expect? She pities him, and what do the books
say about pity?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff thought for a minute and then looked
up with a peculiar light in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a bachelor you&#8217;re doing real well,&#8221; he
said, still thinking hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being a bachelor don&#8217;t mean that I ain&#8217;t never
rubbed elbows with women,&#8221; replied the foreman.
&#8220;There are some people that are bachelors because
they are too darned smart to get roped and branded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
because the moon happens to be real bright. But
I&#8217;ll confess to you that I ain&#8217;t a bachelor because
I didn&#8217;t want to get roped. We won&#8217;t say any
more about that, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Shields, slowly. &#8220;If he tries to
get her before I know that he is straight and clean
and good enough for her, I&#8217;ll just have to stop him
any way I can. First of all, I&#8217;m looking out for
my sister, the h&#8211;l with anybody else. But on
the other hand, if he makes good and wants her bad
enough to rustle for two and she has her mind
made up that she&#8217;d rather have him than stay single
and is head over heels in love with him, I don&#8217;t see
that there&#8217;s anything to worry about. I tell you
that he is a good man, a real man, and if he changes
like I want him to, she would be a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d sight
better off with him than with some dudish tenderfoot
in love with money. He has had such a God-forsaken
life that he will be able to appreciate a
change like that&#8211;he would be square as a brick with
her and attentive and loyal&#8211;and with him she
wouldn&#8217;t run much chance of being left a widow.
Why, I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;ll worship the ground she walks
on&#8211;she could wind him all around her little finger
and he&#8217;d never peep. And she would have the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
protection that walks around these parts. But,
pshaw, all this is too far ahead of the game. How
about that herd of cattle you spoke of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get you the whole herd dirt cheap,&#8221;
replied the foreman. &#8220;And they are as hungry and
healthy a lot as you could wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; responded the sheriff, &#8220;I&#8217;ve made up
my mind to go ranching again. I can&#8217;t stand this
loafing, for it don&#8217;t amount to much more than that
now that The Orphan has graduated out of the outlaw
class. I can run a ranch and have plenty of
time to attend to the sheriff part of it, too. Ever
since I sold the Three-S I have been like a fish out of
water. When I got rid of it I put the money away
in Kansas City, thinking that I might want to go
back at it again. Then I got rid of that mine and
bunked the money with the ranch money. The
interest has been accumulating for a long time now
and I have got something over thirty thousand
lying idle. Now, I&#8217;m going to put it to work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran across Crawford last week, and he is
dead anxious to sell out and go back East&#8211;he don&#8217;t
like the West. I&#8217;ve determined to take the A-Y
off his hands, for it&#8217;s a good ranch, has good buildings
on it, two fine windmills over driven wells,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
good grass and shelters. Why, he has put up shelters
in Long Valley that can&#8217;t be duplicated under
a thousand dollars. His terms are good&#8211;five thousand
down and the balance in installments of two
thousand a year at three per cent., and I can get
<i>over</i> three per cent, while it is lying waiting to be
paid to him. He is too blamed sick of his white
elephant to haggle over terms. He was foolish
to try to run it himself and to sink so much money
in driven wells, windmills and buildings&#8211;it would
astonish you to know how much money he spent in
paint alone. What did he know about ranching,
anyhow? He can&#8217;t hardly tell a cow from a heifer.
He said that he knew how to make money earn
money in the East, but that he couldn&#8217;t make a cent
raising cows.</p>

<p>&#8220;If The Orphan attends to his new deal I&#8217;ll put
him in charge and the rest lies with him. I&#8217;ll provide
him with a good outfit, everything he needs
and, if he makes good and the ranch pays, I&#8217;ll fix
it so he can own a half-interest in it at less than it
cost me, and that will give him a good job to hold
down for the rest of his life. It&#8217;ll be something
for him to tie to in case of squalls, but there ain&#8217;t
much danger of his becoming unsteady, because if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
he was at all inclined to that sort of thing he would
be dead now.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t no fly-away notion, as you know.
I&#8217;ve had an itching for a good ranch for several
years, and for just about that length of time I&#8217;ve
had my eyes on the A-Y. I was going to buy it
when Crawford gobbled it up at that fancy price
and I felt a little put out when he took up his option
on it, but I&#8217;m glad he did, now. Why, Reeves sold
out to Crawford for almost three times what I am
going to pay for it, and it has been improved fifty
per cent. since he has had it. But, of course, there
was more cattle then than there is now. You get
me that herd at a good figure and I&#8217;ll be able to
take care of them very soon now, just as soon as
I close the deal. But, mind you, no Texas cattle
goes&#8211;I don&#8217;t want any Spanish fever in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking some of putting Charley in charge
temporarily, just as soon as Sneed gets some men,
and when The Orphan takes it over things will be
in purty fair shape. I won&#8217;t move out there because
my wife don&#8217;t like ranching&#8211;she wants to
be in town where she is near somebody, but I&#8217;ll
spend most of my time out there until everything
gets in running order. Oh, yes&#8211;in consideration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
of the five thousand down at the time the papers
are signed, Crawford has agreed to leave the ranch-house
furnished practically as it is, and that will be
nice for Helen and The Orphan if they ever should
decide to join hands in double blessedness. You
used to have a lot of fun about the high-faluting
fixings in your ranch-house, but just wait &#8217;til you
see this one! An inside look around will open your
eyes some, all right. It is a wonder, a real wonder!
Running water from the windmills, a bath-room,
sinks in the kitchen, a wood-burning boiler in the
cellar, and all the comforts possible. If Crawford
tries to move all that stuff back East it would cost
him more than he could get for it, and he knows
it, too. It&#8217;s a bargain at twice the price, and I&#8217;m
going to nail it. I can&#8217;t think of anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Blake, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you
could do anything better, that&#8217;s sure. It all depends
on the price, and if you&#8217;re satisfied with that, there
ain&#8217;t no use of turning it down. I know you can
make money out there with any kind of attention,
for I&#8217;m purty well acquainted with the A-Y. And
I&#8217;ll see about the cattle next week, but you better
leave The Orphan stay with me a while longer.
My boys are the best crowd that ever lived in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
bunk-house, and if he minds his business they&#8217;ll
smooth down his corners until you won&#8217;t hardly
know him; and they&#8217;ll teach him a little about the
cow-puncher game if he&#8217;s rusty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the time we had that killing
out there, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Blake asked. &#8220;Well, you
also remember that we agreed to cut out all gunplay
on the ranch in the future, and that I sent
East for some boxing gloves, which were to be used
in case anybody wanted to settle any trouble. They
have been out there for two years now, and haven&#8217;t
been used except in fun. Give the boys a chance
and they&#8217;ll cure him of the itching trigger-finger,
all right. They&#8217;re only a lot of big-hearted, overgrown
kids, and they can get along with the devil
himself if he&#8217;ll let them. But they are hell-fire
and brimstone when aroused,&#8221; then he laughed
softly: &#8220;They heard about your trouble with Sneed
and they shore was dead anxious to call on the Cross
Bar-8 and make a few remarks about long life
and happiness, but I made them wait &#8217;til they should
be sent for.</p>

<p>&#8220;They know all about The Orphan&#8211;that is,
as much as I did before I called to-night. Joe
Haines is a great listener and when he rustles our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
mail once a week he takes it all in, so of course
they know all about it. They had a lot of fun
about the way he made the Cross Bar-8 sit up and
take notice, for they ain&#8217;t wasting any love on
Sneed&#8217;s crowd. And it took Bill Howland over
an hour to tell Joe about his experiences. So when
The Orphan met the outfit they knew him to be the
man who had saved the sheriff&#8217;s sisters, which went
a long way with them. Say, Jim,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;can I tell them what you said about him to-night?
Let me tell them everything, for it&#8217;ll go far with
them, especially with Silent, who had some trouble
with the U-B about five years ago. He was taking
a herd of about three thousand head across their
range and he swears yet at the treatment he got.
Yes? All right, it&#8217;ll make him solid with the
outfit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them anything you want about him,&#8221; said
the sheriff, &#8220;but don&#8217;t say anything about the A-Y.
I want to keep it quiet for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields poured himself a cup of coffee and then
glanced at the clock: &#8220;Too late for a game,
Tom?&#8221; he asked, expectantly.</p>

<p>The foreman laughed: &#8220;It&#8217;s seldom too late for
that,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; cried his host. &#8220;What shall
it be this time&#8211;pinochle or crib?&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman slowly closed his eyes as he replied:
&#8220;Either suits me&#8211;this feed has made me plumb
easy to please. Why, I&#8217;d even play casino to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you say to crib?&#8221; asked the
sheriff. &#8220;You licked me so bad at it the last time
you were here that I hanker to get revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame you for wanting to get
it, but I&#8217;ll tell you right now that you won&#8217;t, for I
can lick the man that invented crib to-night,&#8221;
laughed the foreman. &#8220;Bring out your cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields placed the cards on the table and
arranged things where they would be handy while
his friend shuffled the pack.</p>

<p>The foreman pushed the cards toward his host:
&#8220;There you are&#8211;low deals as usual, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you might as well go ahead and deal,&#8221;
grumbled the sheriff good-naturedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
remember ever cutting low enough for you&#8211;by
George! A five!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake picked up the cards and started to deal,
but the sheriff stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! You haven&#8217;t cut yet!&#8221; Shields cried,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
putting his hand on the cards. &#8220;What are you
doing, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake laughed with delight: &#8220;Well, anybody
that can&#8217;t cut lower than a five hadn&#8217;t ought to
play the game. What&#8217;s the use of wasting time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you never mind about the time&#8211;you
go ahead and beat me,&#8221; cried the sheriff. &#8220;Of all
the nerve!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake picked up the cards again: &#8220;Do you want
to cut again?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it! That five stands!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how would a four do?&#8221; asked the foreman,
lifting his hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s a three!&#8221; he exulted.
&#8220;All that time wasted,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to blazes,&#8221; pleasantly replied the sheriff
as he sorted his hand. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t so bad for
you, not at all bad; you could have done worse,
but I doubt it.&#8221; He discarded, cut, and Blake
turned a six.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven,&#8221; called Shields as he played.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventeen,&#8221; replied Blake, playing a queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No you don&#8217;t, either,&#8221; grinned the sheriff.
&#8220;You can play that four later if you want to, but
not now on twenty-seven. Call it twenty-five,&#8221; he
said, playing an eight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>Blake carefully scanned his hand and finally
played the four, grumbling a little as his friend
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty-one&#8211;first blood,&#8221; remarked the sheriff,
dropping the deuce.</p>

<p>While he pegged his points Blake suddenly
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Jim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;before I forget it I want
to tell you a joke on Humble. He thought it would
be easy money if he taught Lee Lung how to play
poker. He bothered Lee&#8217;s life out of him for several
days, and finally the Chinaman consented to
learn the great American game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake played a six and the sheriff scored two
by pairing, whereupon his opponent made it threes
for six, and took a point for the last card.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying, Humble wanted the cook to
learn poker. Lee&#8217;s face was as blank as a cow&#8217;s,
and Humble had to explain everything several
times before the cook seemed to understand what
he was driving at. Anybody would have thought
he had been brought up in a monastery and that he
didn&#8217;t know a card from an army mule.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake pegged his seven points and picked up his
cards without breaking the story.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>&#8220;But Lee had awful luck, and in half an hour
he owned half of Humble&#8217;s next month&#8217;s pay.
Now, every time he gets a chance he shows Humble
the cards and asks for a game. &#8216;Nicee game,
ploker, nicee game,&#8217; he&#8217;ll say. What Humble says
is pertinent, profane and permeating. Then the
boys guy him to a finish. He&#8217;ll be wanting to
teach Lee how to play fan-tan some day, so the
boys say. Lee must have graduated in poker before
Humble ever heard of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shields laughed heartily and swiftly ran over
his cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen two, four, six, a pair is eight, and a
double run of three is fourteen. Real good,&#8221; he
said as he pegged. &#8220;Passed the crack that time.
What have you got?&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman put his cards down, found three
sixes and then turned the crib face up. &#8220;Pair of
tens and His Highness,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Only
three in that crib!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you get for cutting a three,&#8221;
laughed the sheriff.</p>

<p>The game continued until the striking of the
clock startled the guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Midnight!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Thirty miles before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
I get to bed&#8211;no, no, I can&#8217;t stay with you to-night
&#8211;much obliged, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>He clapped his sombrero on his head and started
for the door: &#8220;Well, better luck next time, Jim&#8211;three
twenty-four hands shore did make a difference.
Right where they were needed, too. So
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry you won&#8217;t stay, Tom,&#8221; called his friend
from the door as the foreman mounted. &#8220;You
might just as well, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, too, but I&#8217;ve got to be on hand
to-morrow&#8211;anyway, it&#8217;s bright moonlight&#8211;so
long!&#8221; he cried as he cantered away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Tom!&#8221; cried the sheriff, leaping from
the porch and running to the gate. &#8220;Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, what is it?&#8221; asked the foreman, drawing
rein and returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke this on your way, it&#8217;ll seem shorter,&#8221;
said the sheriff, holding out a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George, I will!&#8221; laughed Blake. &#8220;That&#8217;s
fine, you&#8217;re all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be good,&#8221; cried the sheriff, watching his friend
ride down the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore enough good&#8211;I have to be,&#8221; floated
back to his ears.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FLYING-MARE</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE Sunday morning following Blake&#8217;s visit to Ford&#8217;s Station found the
Star C in excitement. Notwithstanding the fact
that on every pleasant night after the day&#8217;s work
had been done it was the custom for the outfit to
indulge in a swim, and that Saturday night had
been very pleasant, the Limping Water was being
violently disturbed, and laughter and splashing
greeted the sun as it looked over the rim of the
bank. Cakes of soap glistened on the sand on the
west bank and towels hung from convenient limbs
of the bushes which fringed the creek.</p>

<p>Silent, who was noted among his companions
for the length of time he could stay under water,
challenged them to a submersion test. The rules
were simple, inasmuch as they consisted in all
plunging under at the same time, the winner being
he who was the last man up. Silent had steadfastly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
refused to have his endurance timed, which
his friends mistook for modesty, and no sooner
had all &#8220;ducked under&#8221; than his head popped
up&#8211;but this time he was not alone. Humble,
whose utmost limit was not over half a minute,
grew angry at his inability to make a good showing
and craftily determined to take a handicap.
The two stared at each other for a space and then
burst into laughter, forgetting for the time being
what they should do. Other heads bobbed up,
and the secret was out. Only that Silent was the
best swimmer in the crowd saved him from a
ducking, and as it was he had to grab his clothes
and run.</p>

<p>After being assured that he was forgiven for
his trickery he rejoined his friends and his towel.</p>

<p>More fun was now the rule, for dressing required
care. The sandy west bank sloped gradually
to the water&#8217;s edge, and it was necessary to
stand on one foot on a small stone in the water
while the other was dipped to remove the sand.
Still on one foot the other must be dried, the
stocking put on, then the trouser leg and lastly
the boot, and woe to the man who lost his balance
and splashed stocking and trouser leg as he wildly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
sought to save it! Humble splashed while his
foot was only half-way through the trouser leg,
and The Orphan fared even worse. Then a race
of awkward runners was on toward the bunk
house, where breakfast was annihilated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Tom, what time do we leave?&#8221; asked
Bud for the fifth time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock, you chump,&#8221; replied the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three whole hours yet,&#8221; grumbled Jim as he
again plastered his hair to his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lose my appetite shore,&#8221; worried Humble.
&#8220;We got up too blamed early, that&#8217;s what
we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, here&#8217;s Humble!&#8221; cried Silent in mock
surprise. &#8220;Do <i>you</i> like apricot pie, and gingerbread
and <i>real</i> coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to the devil,&#8221; grumbled Humble.
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been asked at all, only she
couldn&#8217;t very well cut you out of it when she asked
me along. <i>I</i>&#8217;m the one she really wants to feed;
you fellers just happen to tag on behind, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to take Lightning with you, Humble?&#8221;
asked Docile, winking at the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I shore am,&#8221; replied Humble in surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
&#8220;Do you reckon I&#8217;d leave him and that
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>-d Chink all alone together, you sheep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; pessimistically
grumbled Docile, but here he smiled hopefully.
&#8220;Suppose you take Lee Lung and leave the dog
here?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you quit supposing with your feet!&#8221;
sarcastically countered Humble. &#8220;I know you
ain&#8217;t got much brains, but you might exercise what
little you have got once in a while. It won&#8217;t hurt
you none after you get used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to carry him, Humble&#8211;like
a papoose?&#8221; queried Joe with a great show
of interest.</p>

<p>Humble stared at him: &#8220;Huh!&#8221; he muttered,
being too much astonished to say more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you how you are going to carry your
fighting wolfhound,&#8221; Joe said without the quiver
of an eyelash. &#8220;I thought mebby you was going
to sling him on your back like a papoose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry him! Papoose!&#8221; ejaculated Humble
in withering irony. &#8220;What do you reckon his
legs are for? He ain&#8217;t no statue, he ain&#8217;t no ornament,
he&#8217;s a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I knowed he ain&#8217;t no ornament, but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
wasn&#8217;t shore about the rest of it,&#8221; responded Joe.
&#8220;I only wanted to know how he&#8217;d get to town.
There ain&#8217;t no crime in asking about that, is there?
I know he can&#8217;t follow the gait we&#8217;ll hit up for
thirty miles, so I just naturally asked, <i>sabe?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, did you!&#8221; cried Humble, not at
all humbly. &#8220;He can&#8217;t follow us, can&#8217;t he?&#8221; he
yelled belligerently.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shore can&#8217;t, cross my heart,&#8221; asserted
Silent in great earnestness. &#8220;If he runs to Ford&#8217;s
Station after us and gets there inside of two days
I&#8217;ll buy him a collar. That goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; snorted Humble in disgust, &#8220;he won&#8217;t
wear your old collar after he wins it. He&#8217;s got
too much pride to wear anything you&#8217;ll give him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t, you mean,&#8221; jabbed Jim. &#8220;He&#8217;s
so plumb tender that it would strain his back to
carry it. Why, he has to sit down and rest if
more&#8217;n two flies get on the same spot at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t wag his tail more&#8217;n three times in an
hour,&#8221; added Bud, &#8220;and when he scratches hisself
he has to rest for the remainder of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Humble turned to The Orphan in an appealing
way: &#8220;Did you ever see so many d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d fools all
at once?&#8221; he beseeched.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>The Orphan placed his finger to his chin and
thought for fully half a minute before replying:
&#8220;I was just figuring,&#8221; he explained in apology for
his abstraction. Then his face brightened: &#8220;You
can tie him up in a blanket&#8211;that&#8217;s the best way.
Yes, sir, tie him up in a blanket and sling him at
the pommel. We&#8217;ll take turns carrying him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Purple h&#8211;l!&#8221; yelled Humble. &#8220;You&#8217;re
another! The whole crowd are a lot of <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing it, Humble,&#8221; suggested Tad, laughing.
&#8220;Sing it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whistle some of it, and send the rest by mail,&#8221;
assisted Jack Lawson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen th&#8217; dlog?&#8221; came a bland, monotonous
voice from the doorway, where Lee Lung stood
holding a chunk of beef in one hand, while his
other hand was hidden behind his back. Over his
left shoulder projected half a foot of club, which he
thought concealed. &#8220;Seen th&#8217; dlog?&#8221; he repeated,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mirandy and holy hell!&#8221; shouted Humble,
leaping forward at sight of the club. There
was a swish! and Humble rebounded from the
door, at which he stared. From the rear of the
house came more monotonous words: &#8220;Nice dlog-gie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
Pletty Lightling. Here come. Gette glub,&#8221;
and Humble galloped around the corner of the
house, swearing at every jump.</p>

<p>When the laughter had died down Blake smiled
grimly: &#8220;Some day Lee <i>will</i> get that dog, and
when he does he&#8217;ll get him good and hard. Then
we&#8217;ll have to get another cook. I&#8217;ve told him fifty
times if I&#8217;ve told him once not to let it go past a
joke, but it&#8217;s no use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t hurt the cur, he&#8217;s only stringing
Humble,&#8221; said Bud. &#8220;Nobody would hurt a dog
that minded his own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If anybody hit a dog of mine for no cause, he
wouldn&#8217;t do it again unless he got me first,&#8221; quietly
remarked The Orphan.</p>

<p>Jim hastily pointed to the corner of the house
where a club projected into sight: &#8220;There&#8217;s Lee
now!&#8221; he whispered hurriedly. &#8220;He&#8217;s laying for
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sudden spurt of flame and smoke
and the club flew several yards, struck by three
bullets. Humble hopped around the corner holding
his hand, his words too profane for repetition.</p>

<p>Smoke filtered from The Orphan&#8217;s holster and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
eyes opened wide in surprise at the wonderful
quickness of his gunplay, for no one had seen it.
All there was was smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; breathed Blake, staring at the
marksman, who had stepped forward and was
explaining to Humble. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing Shields
was square!&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221; asked Bud of Jim in
whispered awe. &#8220;And I thought <i>I</i> was some
beans with a six-shooter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I heard it&#8211;was they one or six?&#8221;
replied Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was you, Humble,&#8221; explained
The Orphan. &#8220;I thought it was the Chink laying
for the dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span> <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>! Good for you!&#8221; cried Humble in
sudden friendliness. &#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Orphant,
but will you be sure next time? That stung like
blazes,&#8221; he said as he held out his hand. &#8220;I can
always tell a white man by the way he treats a
dog. If all men were as good as dogs this world
would be a blamed sight nicer place to live in, and
don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still going to take Lightning with you, Humble?&#8221;
asked Bud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t going to take Lightning with me!&#8221;
snapped Humble. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave him right
here on the ranch,&#8221; here his voice arose to a roar,
&#8220;and if any sing-song, rope-haired, animated hash-wrastler
gets gay while I&#8217;m gone, I&#8217;ll send him to
his heathen hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; said Blake, snapping his
watch shut. &#8220;Time to get going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; exulted Silent, executing a few
fancy steps toward the corral, his companions close
behind, with the exception of The Orphan, who
had gone into the bunk house for a minute.</p>

<p>As they whooped their way toward the town
Blake noticed that a gold pin glittered at the knot
of the new recruit&#8217;s neck-kerchief, and he chuckled
when he recalled the warning he had given to the
sheriff. He shrewdly guessed that the apricot pie
and the rest of the feast were quite subordinated
by The Orphan to the girl who had given him
the pin.</p>

<p>Bud suddenly turned in his saddle and pointed
to a jackrabbit which bounded away across the
plain like an animated shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if Humble&#8217;s bloodhound was only here,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;we would rope that jack and make the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
cur fight it. It would be a fine fight, all right,&#8221; he
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to the devil,&#8221; grunted Humble, and
he started ahead at full speed. &#8220;Come on!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Come on, you snails!&#8221; and a race
was on.</p>

<p style='letter-spacing:4em; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;'>&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>The citizens of Ford&#8217;s Station saw a low-hanging
cloud of dust which rolled rapidly up from the
west and soon a hard-riding crowd of cowboys, in
gala attire, galloped down the main street of the
town. They slowed to a canter and rode abreast
in a single line, the arms of each man over the
shoulders of his nearest companions, and all sang
at the top of their lungs. On the right end rode
Blake, and on the left was The Orphan. Bill
Howland ran out into the street and spotted his
new friend immediately and swung his hat and
cheered for the man who had helped him out of
two bad holes. The Orphan broke from the line
and shook hands with the driver, his face wreathed
by a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You old son-of-a-gun!&#8221; cried Bill, delighted
at the familiarity from so noted a person as the
former outlaw. &#8220;How are you, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>The line cried warm greeting as it swung around
to shake his hand, and the driver&#8217;s chest took on
several inches of girth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Bill!&#8221; cried Bud with a laugh. &#8220;Seen
your old friend Tex lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; replied Bill. &#8220;I saw him out on
Thirty-Mile Stretch, but he didn&#8217;t do nothing but
swear. He didn&#8217;t want no more run-ins with me,
all right, and, besides, my rifle was across my
knees. He said as how he was going to come
back some day and start things moving about this
old town, and I told him to begin with the Star C
when he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked across the street and waved his hand
at a group of his friends who were looking on.
&#8220;Come on over, fellows,&#8221; he cried, and when they
had done so he turned and introduced The Orphan
to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ugly cuss here is Charley Winter; this
slab-sided curiosity is Tommy Larkin, and here is
his brother Al; Chet Dare, Duke Irwin, Frank
Hicks, Hoke Jones, Gus Shaw and Roy Purvis.
All good fellows, every one of them, and all friends
of the sheriff. Here comes Jed Carr, the only
man in the whole town who ain&#8217;t afraid of me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
since I licked them punchers in the defile. Hullo,
Jed! Shake hands with the man who played h&#8211;l
with the Cross Bar-8 and the Apaches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, Orphan,&#8221; remarked Jed as
he shook hands. &#8220;Punching for the Star C, eh?
Good crowd, most of them, as they run, though
Humble ain&#8217;t very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; grinned that puncher.
&#8220;You&#8217;re some sore about that day when I cleaned
up all your cush at poker, ain&#8217;t you? Ain&#8217;t had
time to get over it, have you? Want to borrow
some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to look out for Humble, Jed,&#8221;
bantered Bud. &#8220;He&#8217;s taken a lesson at poker
from our cook since he played you. Didn&#8217;t you,
Easy?&#8221; he asked Humble.</p>

<p>The roar of laughter which followed Bud&#8217;s
words forced Humble to stand treat: &#8220;Come on
over and have something with the only man in
the crowd that&#8217;s got any money,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>When they had lined up against the bar jokes
began to fly thick and fast and The Orphan felt a
peculiar elation steal over him as he slowly puffed
at his cigar. Suddenly the door flew open and
Bill&#8217;s glass dropped from his hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>&#8220;Bucknell, by God! And as drunk as a fool!&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The puncher whom The Orphan had tied up
above the defile leaned against the door frame
and his gun wavered from point to point unsteadily
as he tried to peer into the dim interior of the
room, his face leering as he sought, with a courage
born of drink, for the man who had made a fool
of him.</p>

<p>A bottle crashed against the wall at his side, and
as he lurched forward, glancing at the broken
glass, a figure leaped to meet him and with agile
strength grasped his right wrist, wheeled and got
his shoulder under Bucknell&#8217;s armpit, took two
short steps and straightened up with a jerk. The
intruder left the floor and flew headforemost
through the air, crashing against the rear wall,
where he fell to the floor and lay quiet. The
Orphan, having foresworn unnecessary gunplay,
and always scorning to shoot a drunken man, had
executed a clever, quick flying-mare.</p>

<p>As the sheriff stepped into the room Blake ran
forward and lifted Bucknell to his feet, supporting
him until he could stand alone. The puncher was
greatly sobered by the shock and blinked confusedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
about him. The Orphan was smoking
nonchalantly at the bar and Bill had just given
the sheriff the victim&#8217;s gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Bucknell, rubbing
his forehead, which was cut and bruised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s the matter, yet,&#8221; answered Shields
shortly. &#8220;But there would have been if you hadn&#8217;t
been too drunk to know what you was doing. I
saw you and tried to get here first, but it&#8217;s all right
now. Take your gun and get out. Here,&#8221; he
exclaimed, &#8220;you promise me to behave yourself
and you can go back to Sneed, for he needs you.
Otherwise, it&#8217;s out of the country after Tex for
you. Is it a go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that, and who done it?&#8221; asked
Bucknell, clinging to the bar. &#8220;What was it?&#8221;
he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was me trying to throw you through the
wall,&#8221; said the sheriff, wishing to give Bucknell no
greater cause for animosity against The Orphan,
and for the peace of the community; and also
because he wished to help The Orphan to refrain
from using his gun in the future. &#8220;And I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
done it, too, only my hand was sweaty. Will you
do what I said?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>Bucknell straightened up and staggered past the
sheriff to where The Orphan stood: &#8220;You done
that, but it&#8217;s all right, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You
ain&#8217;t sore, are you?&#8221; His eyes had a crafty look,
but the dimness of the room concealed it, and The
Orphan did not notice the look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Bucknell, and I ain&#8217;t sore,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be sore if you do what the
sheriff wants you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right,&#8221; replied Bucknell. &#8220;Have
a drink on me, boys. It&#8217;s all right now, ain&#8217;t it?
Have a drink on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more drinking to-day,&#8221; quickly said the
bartender at a look from Shields. &#8220;All the good
stuff is used up and the rest ain&#8217;t fit for dogs, let
alone my friends. Wait &#8217;til next time, when I&#8217;ll
have some new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d bad,&#8221; replied Bucknell,
leering at the crowd. &#8220;Have a smoke, then.
Come on, have a smoke with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shore will, Bucknell,&#8221; responded Shields
quickly.</p>

<p>As the cowboy started for the door the sheriff
placed a hand on his shoulder: &#8220;You behave yourself,
Bucknell,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So long.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FEAST</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>J</span>OYOUS whoops, loud and heartfelt, brought the women to the door of the
sheriff&#8217;s house in time to see their guests dismount. A perfect
babel of words greeted their appearance as the
cowboys burst into a running fire of jokes, salutations
and comments. Even the ponies seemed to
know that something important and unusual was
taking place, for they cavorted and bit and squealed
to prove that they were in accord with the spirit of
their riders and that thirty miles in less than three
hours had not subdued them. Bright colors prevailed,
for the neck-kerchiefs in most cases were
new and yet showed the original folding creases,
while new, clean thongs of rawhide and glittering
bits of metal flashed back the sunlight. Spurs glittered
and the clean looking horses appeared to have
had a dip in the Limping Water. Blake had
hunted through the carpeted rooms of his ranch-house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
for decorations, and in the drawer of a table
he had found a bunch of ribbons of many kinds and
shades. These now fluttered from the pommels of
the saddles and in one case a red ribbon was twined
about the leg of a vicious pinto, and the pinto was
not at all pleased by the decoration.</p>

<p>The sheriff led the way to the house closely
followed by Blake, the others coming in the order
of their nerve. The Orphan was last, not from
lack of courage, but rather because of strategy.
He thought that Helen would remain at the door
to welcome each arrival and if he was in the van
he would be passed on to make way for those
behind him. Being the last man he hoped to be
able to say more to her than a few words of greeting.
As he mounted the steps she was drawn into
the room for something and he stepped to one side
on the porch, well knowing that she would miss
him.</p>

<p>Bud poked his head out the door and started to
say something, but The Orphan fiercely whispered
for him to be silent and to disappear, which Bud
did after grinning exasperatingly.</p>

<p>The man on the porch was growing impatient
when he heard the light swish of skirts around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
corner of the house. Sauntering carelessly to the
corner he looked into the back-yard and saw Helen
with a tray in her hands, nearing the back door.
She espied him and stopped, flushing suddenly as
he leaped lightly to the ground and walked rapidly
toward her. Her cheeks became a deeper red when
he stopped before her and took the tray, for his
eyes were rebellious and would not be subdued,
and the first thing she saw was the gold pin which
stood out boldly against the dark blue neck-kerchief.
She was rarely beautiful in her white
dress, and the ribbon which she wore at her throat
did not detract in its effect. Later her sister was
to wonder if it was a coincidence that the ribbon
and his neck-kerchief were so good a match in
color.</p>

<p>She welcomed him graciously and he felt a sudden
new and strangely exhilarating sensation steal
over him as he took the hand she held out, the tray
all the while bobbing recklessly in his other hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you in the house paying your
respects to your hostess?&#8221; she chided half in jest
and half in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The delay will but add to my fervor when I
do,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;for I will have had a stimulus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
then. As long as the hostesses are four and insist
on not being together, how can I pay my respects
all at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is only one hostess,&#8221; she laughingly
corrected. &#8220;I am afraid you are not very good at
making excuses. You probably never felt the need
to make them before. You see, I, too, am only a
guest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We two,&#8221; he corrected daringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to see you,&#8221; she said, leading
away from plurals. &#8220;You are looking very well
and much more contented. And then, this is ever
so much nicer than our first meeting, isn&#8217;t it? No
horrid Apaches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gotten so that I rather like Apaches,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;They are so useful at times. But you
mustn&#8217;t try to tempt me to subordinate that eventful
day, not yet. It can&#8217;t be done, although I&#8217;ve
never tried to do it,&#8221; he hastily assured her, making
a gesture of helplessness. &#8220;Sometimes an unexpected
incident will change the habits of a lifetime,
making the days seem brighter, and yet, somehow,
adding a touch of sadness. I have been a
stranger to myself since then, restless, absentminded,
moody and hungry for I know not what.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
He paused and then slowly continued, &#8220;I must
beg to remain loyal to that day of all days when
you bathed an outlaw&#8217;s head and showed your
love for fair play and kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; she cried, for one instant meeting
his eager eyes. &#8220;Why, I thought it was a terrible
day! And you really think differently?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much so,&#8221; he assured her as she withdrew
her hand from his. &#8220;You see, it was such
a new and delightful experience to save a stage
coach and then find that it was a hospital with a
wonderful doctor. I accused that Apache of being
stingy with his lead, for he might just as well have
given me a few more wounds to have dressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she laughingly retorted, &#8220;it was almost
as new an experience as starting on a long and supposedly
peaceful journey and suddenly finding oneself
in the middle of a desert surrounded by dead
Indians and doctoring an Indian killer who was at
war with one&#8217;s brother. And that after a terrible
shaking up lasting for over an hour. Truly it is a
day to be remembered. Now, don&#8217;t you think you
should hurry in and greet my sister-in-law?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly,&#8221; he quickly responded. &#8220;But
before I lose the opportunity I must ask you if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
will care if I ride over and see you occasionally,
because it is terribly lonely on that ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that we shall always be glad to see
you whenever you can call,&#8221; she replied, smiling up
at him. &#8220;We are all very deep in your debt and
brother and all of us think a great deal of you.
Are you satisfied on the Star C, and do you like
your work and your companions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he cried happily, &#8220;I will ride
over and see you once in a while. But as for my
work, it is delightful! The Star C is fine and my
companions&#8211;well, they just simply can&#8217;t be beat!
they are the finest, whitest set of men that ever
gathered under one roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very nice, I am glad that you find things
so congenial,&#8221; she replied in sincerity. &#8220;James
was sure that you would, for Mr. Blake is an old
friend of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very anxious about this pin,&#8221; he said, putting
his hand on it. &#8220;May I keep it for a while
longer?&#8221; he asked with a note of appeal in his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;if you wish to. But
only as long as you do not displease me, and you
will not do that, will you? James has such deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
confidence in you that I know you will not disappoint
him. You will justify him in his own mind
and in the minds of his acquaintances and prove
that he has not erred in judgment, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am the sum total of your brother&#8217;s trouble,
he will have a path of roses to wander through all
the rest of his life,&#8221; he responded earnestly. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m really afraid that you will never again wear
this pin as a possession of yours. Of course you
can borrow it occasionally,&#8221; and he smiled whimsically,
&#8220;but as far as displeasing you is concerned,
it is mine forever. It will really and truly be mine
on that condition, won&#8217;t it? My very own if I do
not forfeit it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish it so,&#8221; she replied quickly, her face
radiant with smiles. &#8220;And you will work hard
and you will never shoot a man, no matter what
the provocation may be, unless it is absolutely necessary
to do it for the saving of your own life or that
of a friend or an innocent man. Promise me that!&#8221;
she commanded imperatively, pleased at being able
to dictate to him. &#8220;Men like you never break a
promise,&#8221; she added impulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise never to shoot a man, woman, child
or&#8211;or anybody,&#8221; he laughingly replied, &#8220;unless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
it is necessary to save life. And I&#8217;ll work real
hard and save my money. And on Sundays, rain
or shine, I&#8217;ll ride in and report to my new foreman.&#8221;
Then a bit of his old humor came to him:
&#8220;For I just about need this pin&#8211;knots are so
clumsy, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at the knot which held the pin and
laughed merrily, leading the way into the house.</p>

<p>As they entered Humble was extolling the virtues
of his dog, to the broad grins of his companions,
who constantly added amendments and
made corrections <i>sotto voce.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, here they are!&#8221; cried the sheriff in such
a tone as to suffuse Helen&#8217;s face with blushes. The
Orphan coolly shook hands with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, here we are, Sheriff, every one of us,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t be expected to stay away
when Mrs. Shields put herself to so much trouble,
and we&#8217;re all happy and proud to be so honored.
How do you do, Mrs. Shields,&#8221; he continued as he
took her hand. &#8220;It is awful kind of you to go to
such trouble for a lot of lonely, hungry fellows
like us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness sakes!&#8221; she cried, delighted at his
words and pleased at the way he had parried her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
husband&#8217;s teasing thrust. &#8220;Why, it was no trouble
at all&#8211;you are all my boys now, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Shields,&#8221; he replied slowly.
&#8220;We will do our very best to prove ourselves
worthy of being called your boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff regarded The Orphan with a look
of approbation and turned to his sister Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s fool, eh, Sis?&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering how you ever made up
your mind to share him with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t!&#8221; she begged in confusion.
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t tease me now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Sis,&#8221; he replied in a whisper, pinching
her ear. &#8220;I&#8217;ll save it all up for some other
time, some time when he ain&#8217;t around to turn it
off, eh? But I don&#8217;t blame him a bit for exploring
the yard first&#8211;you&#8217;re the prettiest girl this side
of sun-up,&#8221; he said, beaming with love and pride.
&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a change, eh? Worth a kiss?&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed him hurriedly and then left the room
to attend to her duties in the kitchen, and he sauntered
over to where The Orphan was talking with
Mrs. Shields, his hand rubbing his lips and a mischievous
twinkle in his kind eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice the new flower-bed right by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
side of the house as you ran past it a while ago?&#8221;
he asked, flashing a keen warning to his wife.</p>

<p>The Orphan searched his memory for the flower-bed
and not finding it, turned and smiled, not willing
to admit that his attention had been too fully
taken up with a fairer flower than ever grew in
earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, it is real pretty,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing much,&#8221; gravely replied the sheriff
as he edged away. &#8220;Only we were thinking
of putting a flower-bed there, although I haven&#8217;t
had time to get at it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan flushed and glanced quickly at the
outfit, who were too busy cracking jokes and laughing
to pay any attention to the conversation across
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;James!&#8221; cried Mrs. Shields. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
ashamed of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you tickle a mule,&#8221; said the sheriff, grinning
at his friend, &#8220;you want to look out for the
kick. Come again sometime, Sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;James!&#8221; his wife repeated, &#8220;how can you be
so mean! Now, stop teasing and behave yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>&#8220;For a long time I&#8217;ve been puzzled about what
you resembled, but now I have your words for it,&#8221;
easily countered The Orphan. &#8220;Thank you for
putting me straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff grinned sheepishly and scratched his
head: &#8220;I&#8217;m an old fool,&#8221; he grumbled, and forthwith
departed to tell Helen of the fencing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shields excused herself and followed her
husband into the kitchen to look after the dinner,
and The Orphan sauntered over to his outfit just
as Jim looked out of a rear window. Jim turned
quickly, his face wearing a grin from ear to ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Bud!&#8221; he called eagerly. &#8220;Bud!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Bud, turning at the hail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over here for a minute, I want to show
you something,&#8221; Jim replied, &#8220;but don&#8217;t let Humble
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bud obeyed and looked: &#8220;Jimminee!&#8221; he exulted.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t that look sumptious, though? This
is where we shine, all right.&#8221; Then turned:
&#8220;Hey, fellows, come over here and take a look.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they crowded around the window Humble
discovered that something was in the wind and
he followed them. What they saw was a long
table beneath two trees, and it was covered with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
white cloth and dressed for a feast. Bud turned
quickly from the crowd and forcibly led Humble
to a side window before that unfortunate had seen
anything and told him to put his finger against the
glass, which Humble finally did after an argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel the pain?&#8221; Bud asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; Humble replied, looking critically
at his finger. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Bud. &#8220;Think it over,
Humble,&#8221; he advised, turning away.</p>

<p>Humble again put his finger to the glass and
then snorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Locoed chump! Prosperity is making him
nutty!&#8221; When he turned he saw his friends laughing
silently at him and making grimaces, and a light
suddenly broke in upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That joke is so old
I plumb forgot it years ago! Spring something
that hasn&#8217;t got whiskers and a halting step, will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim laughed and suggested a dance, but was
promptly squelched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heathen!&#8221; snorted Blake in mock horror.
&#8220;This is Sunday! If you want to dance wait till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
you get back to the ranch&#8211;suppose one of the
women was here and heard you say that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I forgot all about it being Sunday,&#8221; replied
Jim, quickly looking to see if any of the
women were in the room. &#8220;We&#8217;re regular barbarians,
ain&#8217;t we!&#8221; he exclaimed in self-condemnation
and relief when he saw that no women were
present. &#8220;We&#8217;re regular land pirates, ain&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be asking to play poker yet, or have a
race,&#8221; jabbed Humble with malice. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t
got no sense and never did have any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; retorted Jim belligerently, &#8220;I won&#8217;t
try to learn a Chinee cook how to play poker and
get skinned out of my pay, anyhow! Got
enough?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;or shall I tell of the time you
drifted into Sagetown and asked<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, you fool!&#8221; whispered Humble ferociously.
&#8220;Yu&#8217;ll get skun if you say too much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Skun&#8217; is real good,&#8221; retorted Jim. &#8220;Got
any more of them new words to spring on us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen had been passing to and fro past the
window and Docile Thomas here put his marveling
into words, for he had been casting covert glances
at her, but now his restraint broke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; he exclaimed in a whisper to Jack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
Lawson. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t she a regular hummer, now!
Lines like a thoroughbred, face like a dream and
a smile what shore is a winner! See her hair&#8211;fine
and dandy, eh? She&#8217;s in the two-forty class,
all right!&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;Why, when this country
wakes up to what&#8217;s in it the sheriff will have to
put up a stockade around this house and mount
guard. Everybody from Bill up will be stampeding
this way to talk business with the sheriff. No
wonder The Orphan has got a bee in his bonnet&#8211;lucky
dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can take care of my pay every month
just as soon as she says the word,&#8221; Jack replied.
&#8220;But suppose you look away once in a while? Suppose
you shift your sights! You, too, Humble,&#8221;
he said, suddenly turning on the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me what?&#8221; asked Humble, without interest
and without shifting his gaze. &#8220;What are you
talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at something else, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore I see,&#8221; replied Humble. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m looking. Do you think I look with my eyes
shut! Gee, but ain&#8217;t she a picture, though!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shore is, but give it a rest, take a vacation,
you chump!&#8221; retorted Jack. &#8220;You&#8217;re staring at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>
her like she had you hoodooed. Come out of your
trance&#8211;wake up and make a fool of yourself some
other way. Don&#8217;t aim all the time at her. Mebby
Lee Lung has killed your dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he has we&#8217;ll need a new cook,&#8221; replied
Humble with decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys! Don&#8217;t start milling!&#8221; cried
the sheriff, suddenly entering the room. &#8220;Dinner&#8217;s
all ready and waiting for us. And I shore
hope you have all got your best appetites with you,
because Margaret likes to see her food taken care of
lively. If you don&#8217;t clean it all up she&#8217;ll think you
don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; he said, winking at Blake, &#8220;and if
she once gets that notion in her head it will be no
more invitations for the Star C.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was much excitement in the crowd, and
the replies came fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t had anything good to eat for fifteen
long, aching years!&#8221; cried Bud. &#8220;When I get
through you&#8217;ll need a new table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here, only for thirty years,&#8221; replied Jim
hastily. &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t sleep last night for thinking
about the glorious surprise my abused stomach
was due to have to-day. I&#8217;ll bet my gun on my
performance if the track is heavy, all right. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
not poor on speed, and I&#8217;m a stayer from Stayersville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t be among the also rans, you can
bet on that,&#8221; laughed Silent. &#8220;I don&#8217;t weigh very
much, but I&#8217;m geared high.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s good!&#8221; cried Humble, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet
it&#8217;s real good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n good, you mean!&#8221; corrected Jack.
&#8220;Hey, fellows!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;did you hear what
Humble said? He said that he&#8217;d bet it was <i>real</i>
good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horray for Humble, the wit of the Star C,&#8221;
laughed Docile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for the apricot pie!&#8221; exulted Charley.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I get square on Blake for rubbing
it in all these months about the fine pie he gets
over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no apricot pie,&#8221; gravely lied the
sheriff in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Charley in alarm. &#8220;There
ain&#8217;t none for me! Oh, well, you can&#8217;t lose me in
daylight, for I&#8217;ll double up on everything else. I
ain&#8217;t going to get left, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wake me up,&#8221; begged Joe Haines.
&#8220;Let me dream on in peace and plenty. Grub,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
real, genuine grub, grub what is grub! Oh,
joy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Shields hurried into the room and then
paused in surprise when she saw that the outfit had
not moved toward the feast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land sakes!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you boys
hungry, or is James up to some of his everlasting
teasing again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk to her, Bud,&#8221; whispered Jim eagerly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so scary I shore can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go ahead, Bud!&#8221; came instant and unanimous
endorsement in whispers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; began Bud, clearing his throat,
glancing around uneasily to be sure that the crowd
was giving him moral backing, and feeling uncomfortable,
&#8220;we was just getting up a&#8211;a<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B, C, D,&#8221; prompted Jim in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We was just getting up a resolution of thanks,
Mrs. Shields,&#8221; he continued, stabbing his elbow
into the stomach of the offending Jim. &#8220;You shut
up!&#8221; he fiercely whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;m carrying one
hundred and forty pounds now without the saddle!&#8221;
Then he continued: &#8220;We all of us are plumb
tickled about this, so plumb tickled we don&#8217;t hardly
know what to say<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; whispered Jim, folding his arms
across his stomach. &#8220;You&#8217;re proving it, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silent and Jack hauled Jim to the rear and Bud
continued unruffled: &#8220;But we want to thank you,
ma&#8217;am, from the bottoms, the very lowest bottoms
of our hearts for your kindness to a orphant outfit
what ain&#8217;t had anything to eat since the war, and
very little during it. Joe Haines, here, ma&#8217;am, was
just saying as how he was a-scared that it is all
a dream<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t neither!&#8221; fiercely contradicted Joe in
a whisper, looking very self-conscious. He was
whisked to the rear to join Jim and the speech
went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is afraid it is a dream, ma&#8217;am, and I know
we all of us have more or less doubts about it being
really true. But, ma&#8217;am, we shore are anxious to
find out all about it. We&#8217;ve rid thirty miles to see
for ourselves, and I don&#8217;t reckon you&#8217;ll have any
fears about our appetites being left at home when
you sizes up the wreck left in the path of the storm
after the stampede is over. The boys want to give
you three cheers even if it is Sunday, ma&#8217;am, for
your kindness to them, and I&#8217;m shore one of the
boys!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>&#8220;Hip, hip, horray!&#8221; yelled the crowd, surging
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Bud!&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you, Buddie!&#8221; exulted Charley,
slapping him extra heartily on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you had it in you, Bud!&#8221; cried
Silent. &#8220;It was shore a dandy speech, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll send you to Congress for that, some
day, Bud,&#8221; cried Jack Lawson. &#8220;You&#8217;re all
right!&#8221;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;I once had a piece of pie, a piece of pie, a piece of pie,</p>
<p>I once had a piece of pie, when I was five years old,&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>sang Charley as he pranced toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Go on, Charley, go on!&#8221; cried his
companions joyously.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll have another piece, another piece, another piece,</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ll have another piece, that&#8217;s two all told.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Good bye, Lee Lung, good bye Lee Lung,</p>
<p>Good bye, Lee Lung, we&#8217;re going to forget you now!&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Again on that Lee Lung, altogether&#8211;it hits
me right!&#8221; cried Bud, and the matter pertaining
to the farewells to Lee Lung was promptly and
properly attended to in heartfelt sincerity.</p>

<p>The ladies laughed with delight, and Mrs.
Shields whispered to her husband, who nodded and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
escorted The Orphan to a seat near the head of
the table, where he was flanked by Helen and
Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grab your partners, boys,&#8221; the sheriff cried,
pointing to the chairs. There was a hasty piling
of belts and guns on the ground, and after much
confusion all were seated.</p>

<p>The sheriff arose: &#8220;Boys, Mrs. Shields wants
me to tell you how pleased she is to have you all
here. She has felt plumb sorry about you and she
shore has shuddered at the thought of a Chinee
cook<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which same we all do&#8211;it&#8217;s chronic,&#8221; interposed
Jim to laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;She wants you to make yourselves at home,&#8221;
continued the sheriff, &#8220;learn the lay of the land
around this range and never forget the trail leading
here, because she insists that when any of you
come to town you have simply got to pay us a visit
and see if there is a piece of pie or cake to eat
before you go back to that cook. And Tom says
that he&#8217;ll fire the first man who renigs<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to carry the mail hereafter!&#8221; cried
Bud, scowling fiercely at Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I can shoot first, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>
the mail carrier. &#8220;I was just a-wondering if it
wouldn&#8217;t be better to come in twice a week for it
instead of once. We might get more letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll bid for your job next year,&#8221; laughed
Silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I coax you to eat,&#8221; continued the sheriff,
&#8220;I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong word, Sheriff,&#8221; interposed Humble.
&#8220;Not coax, but force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to ask you to reverse things a little,
and drink a standing toast to the man who
saved the stage, to the man who saved Miss Ritchie
and my sisters and who made this dinner possible.
This would be far from a happy day but for him.
I want you to drink to the long life and happiness
of The Orphan. All up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The clink of glasses was lost in the spontaneous
cheer which burst from the lips of the former outlaw&#8217;s
new friends, and he sat confused and embarrassed
with a sudden timidity, his face crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speech!&#8221; cried Jim, the others joining in the
cry. &#8220;Speech! Speech!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, after some urging, The Orphan slowly
arose to his feet, a foolish smile playing about his
lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t anything,&#8221; he said deprecatingly.
&#8220;You all would have done it, every one of you.
But I&#8217;m glad it was me. I&#8217;m glad I was on hand,
although it wasn&#8217;t anything to make all this fuss
about,&#8221; and he dropped suddenly into his seat,
feeling hot and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we have different ideas about its being
nothing,&#8221; replied the sheriff. &#8220;Now, boys, a toast
to Bill Halloway,&#8221; he requested. &#8220;Bill couldn&#8217;t
get here to-day, but we mustn&#8217;t forget him. His
splendid grit and driving made it possible for our
friend to play his hand so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Bill!&#8221; cried Silent, leaping to his
feet with the others. When seated again he looked
quickly at his glass and turned to Bud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Real sweet cider!&#8221; he exulted. &#8220;Good Lord,
but how time gallops past! I&#8217;d almost forgotten
what it was like! It&#8217;s been over twenty years since
I tasted any! Ain&#8217;t it fine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering what it was,&#8221; remarked
Humble, a trace of awe in his voice as he refilled
his glass. &#8220;It&#8217;s shore enough sweet cider, and
blamed good, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charley was romping with the mail carrier and
he had a sudden inspiration: &#8220;Speech from Joe!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
Speech for the pieces of pie and cake he&#8217;s due to
get!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, boy,&#8221; Joe gravely replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m the mail carrier. I don&#8217;t have to go on jury
duty, lead religion round-ups, go to war or make
speeches. As the books say, I&#8217;m exempt. All I
have to do is punch cows, rustle the mail and eat
pie and cake once a week,&#8221; he said, glancing at
Bud, who glared and groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Joe!&#8221; cried Humble, waving his
glass excitedly. &#8220;You&#8217;re shore all right, you are,
and I&#8217;m your deputy, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not my deputy, but my delirium,&#8221; corrected
Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; cried Silent as his plate was passed
to him. &#8220;Chicken, real chicken! Mashed potatoes,
mashed turnips and dressing and gravy! And
here comes stewed corn, boiled onions and jelly
and mother&#8217;s bread. And stewed tomatoes? Well,
well! I guess we ain&#8217;t going to be well fed, and
real happy, eh, fellows? My stomach won&#8217;t know
what&#8217;s the matter&#8211;it&#8217;ll think it died and went to
heaven by mistake. Holy smoke! It hurts my
eyes. What, cranberry jam? Well, I&#8217;m just going
to close my eyes for a minute if you don&#8217;t mind;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>
I want to recuperate from the shock. This is where
I live again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Humble stared in rapture at the feast before him
and finally heaved a long drawn sigh of doubt and
content.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he cried softly, a far-away look in his
eyes. &#8220;Look at it, just look at it! Just like I
used to get when I was a little tad back in Connecticut&#8211;but
that was shore a long time ago.
Well,&#8221; he exclaimed, bracing up and bravely forgetting
his boyhood, &#8220;there&#8217;s one thing I hope, and
that is that Lee beats my dog. Then I can shoot
him and get square for all these years of imitation
grub what he&#8217;s handed out to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Tom!&#8221; eagerly cried Charley, &#8220;why
can&#8217;t we handle a herd of chickens out on the ranch,
and have a garden? Why, we could have eggs
every day and chickens on holidays!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder Tom likes to ride to town,&#8221;
laughed Silent. &#8220;Gee whiz, I&#8217;d walk it for pie and
cake and real genuine coffee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk it!&#8221; snorted Jim. &#8220;Huh, I&#8217;d crawl,
and stand on my head, knock my feet together and
crow every half mile! Walk it, huh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Merriment reigned supreme throughout the meal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>
and when the bashfulness had worn off the conversation
became fast and furious, abounding in terse
wit, verbal attacks and clever counters, and in
concentrated onslaughts against the unfortunate
Humble, who soon found, however, a new and
loyal champion in Miss Ritchie, who took his part.
Her assistance was so doughty as to more than
once put to rout his tormentors, and before the dessert
had been reached he was her devoted slave
and admirer and was henceforth to sing her
praises at every opportunity, and even to make
opportunities.</p>

<p>At The Orphan&#8217;s end of the table all was serene.
He, Helen, Blake and the sheriff found much to
talk about, and all the while Mrs. Shields regarded
the four in a motherly way, and tempered the keenness
of her husband&#8217;s wit, for he was prone to break
lances with The Orphan and to tease his sister,
much to her confusion. She was very happy, for
here at her side were her husband and the man
she had feared would harm him, laughing and joking
and the best of friends; and down the table
a crowd of big-hearted boys, her boys now, were
having the time of their lives. They were good
boys, too, she told herself; a trifle rough, but sterling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>
at the heart, and every one of them a loyal
friend. How good it was to see them eat and hear
them laugh, all happy and mischievous. The welding
of the units had been finished, and now the
Star C and The Orphan were one in spirit.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>PREPARATION</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>A</span>FTER the dinner at the sheriff&#8217;s house, life meant much to The Orphan,
for the dinner had done its work and done it well. Whatever
had been missing to complete the good fellowship
between him and the others had been supplied
and by the time the outfit was ready to leave
for home, all corners had been rounded and all
rough edges smoothed down. With his outfit he
was in hearty, loyal accord, and the spirit of the
ranch had become his own. With the sheriff his
already strong liking had been stripped of any
undesirable qualities, and he felt that Shields was
not only the whitest man he had ever met, but also
his best friend. He had become more intimate
with the sheriff&#8217;s household, and for Mrs. Shields
he had only love and respect.</p>

<p>With Helen his cup was full to overflowing, for
he had managed to hold several long talks with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
during the afternoon, and to his mind he had heard
nothing detrimental to his hopes. His eyes had
been opened as to what it was he had been hungering
for, and the knowledge thrilled him to his finger-tips.
He was a red-blooded, clean-limbed man,
direct of words and purpose, reveling in a joyous,
surging, vigorous health, in tune with his surroundings;
he was dominant, fearless, and he had a
saving grace in his humor. To him came visions
of the future, golden as the sunrise, rich in promise
and assurance as to a happiness such as he could
only feebly feel. Himself he was sure of, for he
feared no failure on his part; as far as he was concerned
it was won. Helen, he believed from what
the day had given him, would not refuse him when
the time came for her to decide, and his effervescent
spirits sent a song to his lips, which he hurled to the
sky as a war-cry, a slogan of triumph and a defiance.</p>

<p>As yet he knew nothing of the sheriff&#8217;s plans, and
his thoughts concerning his future position in the
community did not dare to soar above that of foreman
of some ranch. To this end he would bend
his energies with all the power of his splendid
trinity&#8211;heart, mind and body. He was far too
happy to think of failure, because there would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span>
none; had the word passed through his mind he
would have laughed it into oblivion. His experience
gave him confidence, for he was no weakling
sheltered and protected by any guiding angel; to
the contrary, he was the survivor of a bitter war
against conditions which would have destroyed a
less strong man; he was victor over himself and
his enemies, a conqueror of adverse conditions, a
hewer of his own path; his enemies had been his
best friends, and his long fight, his salvation. For
ten years he had constantly fought a bitter fight
against nature and man; hunger and thirst, plots
and ambushes had all played their parts, and he
had won out over all of them. He was young,
hopeful and unafraid, and now that he was on the
right trail he would bend every energy to stay there,
and he would stay there, be the opposition what it
might; and if the opposition should be man, and of
a strength dangerous to him, he would destroy it
as he had destroyed others before it. While now
scorning to use his gun on every provocation he
would depend upon it as on a court of last resort&#8211;and
its decision would be final.</p>

<p>He held ill wishes against no man save one, and
that one was the man who had placed the rope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328'></a>328</span>
about the neck of his father. He did not know
that man&#8217;s name, and he did not know that he
might not be among those who had already paid
for that crime. But should he ever learn that he
lived he would take payment in full be the cost what
it might.</p>

<p>But he had no thoughts for strife, he only knew
that the sun had never been so bright, the sky so
blue and the plain so full of life and beauty as it
was on this perfect day. Only one other day
rivaled it&#8211;the day he had swayed weakly by the
side of a dusty coach and had felt warm, soft
fingers touching his forehead. But, he told himself
with joy, there would be days to come which would
eclipse even that.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his reverie by the approach
of the foreman, who gave him a hearty hail and
smiled at the happy expression on the puncher&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you look like you had struck it rich!&#8221;
cried Blake. &#8220;What is it, gold or silver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold or silver!&#8221; cried The Orphan in contempt
at such cheapness. &#8220;By God, Blake, I
wouldn&#8217;t sell my claim for all the gold and silver
in this fool earth! Gold or silver! Why, man, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span>
know where there is plenty of both. Here,&#8221; he
cried, plunging his hand into his chaps pocket,
&#8220;look at this!&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman looked and whistled and took the
object into his hand, where he examined it critically.
&#8220;By George, it&#8217;s the yellow metal, all right, and
blamed near pure!&#8221; He returned it to its owner
and added: &#8220;That&#8217;s the real stuff, Orphan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; replied the other as he pocketed the
nugget. &#8220;And I know where it came from.
There&#8217;s plenty left that&#8217;s just like it, but I wouldn&#8217;t
go after it if it was diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Blake in surprise.
&#8220;By George, I&#8217;d go to-morrow, to-night, if I knew.
Gold like that ain&#8217;t to be sneered at. It spells
ranches, ease, plenty, anything you want. And you
wouldn&#8217;t go for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t, and I won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the
puncher. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay right here on this
range and make good with my hands and brains.
I&#8217;m going to win the game with the cards I hold,
and when I say win I mean it. There are times
when gold is a dangerous thing to have, and this
is one of them, as you&#8217;ll understand when I disclose
my hand. When I win I won&#8217;t need gold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330'></a>330</span>
bad enough to go through hell and hot water for
it and risk not getting back to my claim, and it&#8217;s
one hundred to one that I wouldn&#8217;t get back, too.
And if I lose, mind you, <i>if</i>, I won&#8217;t have any use
for it. I picked that nugget up in the middle of the
damnedest desert God ever made, and when I got
off it I was loco for a week. I won&#8217;t tell any
friend of mine where it is because I want my friends
to go on drawing their breath. I need my friends
a whole lot, and that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t tell you where
it is. I was saving that for my enemies. Two have
gone after it already, and haven&#8217;t been heard of
since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are the first man who ever told
me that gold isn&#8217;t worth going after, and you
have convinced me that in your case you are right,&#8221;
laughed the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have to be told if you knew that
desert as I do,&#8221; replied The Orphan.</p>

<p>&#8220;How was the sheriff last night?&#8221; asked Blake.
&#8220;Or didn&#8217;t you notice, being too much occupied
in your claim?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan looked at him and then laughed
softly: &#8220;He was the same as ever&#8211;the best man
I ever knew. But how in thunder do you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span>
about my claim? How did you know what I
meant? I thought that I had covered that trail
pretty well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake put his hand on his friend&#8217;s shoulders
and gravely looked at him: &#8220;Son, having eyes, I
see; having ears, I hear; having brains, I think. If
you have been fooling yourself that you are on
a quiet trail, just listen to this: There ain&#8217;t a man
who knows you well that don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re
playing for, even Bill had it all mapped out the
second time he saw you. And most of us wish you
luck. You&#8217;re not a man who needs help, but if
you <i>do</i> need it, you know where to come for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Blake,&#8221; replied The Orphan,
eagerly filling his lungs with the crisp air. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why I ain&#8217;t hankering for that gold&#8211;I&#8217;m too
blamed busy making my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what I wanted to speak to you about is
this,&#8221; said the foreman, thinking quickly as to how
to say it. &#8220;Old man Crawford got me to promise
that I&#8217;d pick up a herd of cows for him before fall.
Now, I would just as soon do it myself as not,
but if you want to try your hand at it, go ahead.
He wants about five thousand, to be delivered in
five herds, a thousand each, at his corrals. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>
won&#8217;t pay any more than the regular price for
them, and the more you can drop the price the
better he will like it, of course. They must be
good, healthy cattle and be delivered to him before
payment is made. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say that it&#8217;s a go!&#8221; cried The Orphan.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some great luck lately!&#8221; he exulted.
&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go after them whenever you say the
word, to-night if you say so. And I&#8217;ll get the
right number and kind or know the reason why.
And I&#8217;ll take a hand in driving the last herd to
him myself. Good Lord, what luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake talked a while longer about the trip, giving
necessary instructions about prices and where
he would be likely to find the herd, and then rode
off in the direction of Ford&#8217;s Station for a consultation
with his friend, the sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Tom!&#8221; came from the stage office as
he rode past. He quickly turned his head and then
stopped, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hullo, Bill,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Glad to see
you. How are things? Had any trouble lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope, times are real dull since that day in the
defile,&#8221; Bill answered with a grin. &#8220;I saw Tex
once at Sagetown, but he ain&#8217;t talking none these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span>
days, he&#8217;s too busy thinking. You see, I&#8217;ve got a
purty strong combination backing me and nobody
feels like starting it a-going, because there ain&#8217;t no
telling just where it&#8217;ll stop. The Orphant and the
sheriff make a blamed good team, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None better at any game, Bill,&#8221; replied Blake.
&#8220;And you used the right word, too. They&#8217;re
going to pull together from now on, in fact, the
Star C will be in harness with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk!&#8221; cried Bill enthusiastically.
&#8220;I always said that Orphant was a white
man, even before I ever saw him,&#8221; he said, forgetting
much that he might be in hearty accord. &#8220;He
can call on me any time he needs me, you bet. He
cheated the devil twice with me, and I ain&#8217;t a-going
to forget it. But say, what do you think of the
sheriff&#8217;s sister, Helen? Ain&#8217;t she a winner, hey?
Finest girl these parts have ever seen, all right,
and her friend ain&#8217;t second by no length, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bill,&#8221; exclaimed Blake, a twinkle coming
to his eyes, &#8220;you are not allowing yourself
to get captured, are you? That&#8217;s a risky game,
like starting up The Orphan and the sheriff, for
there&#8217;s no telling just where it will stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t letting myself get captured,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>
sighed Bill. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t no fool. Bill Howland
knows a thing or two, which he learned not more
than a thousand years ago. I&#8217;ve got it all sized
up. And since then I&#8217;ve seen a certain bang-up
puncher hitting the trail for the sheriff&#8217;s house
some regular twice a week. Nope, I&#8217;m a batchler
now and forever, long may I wave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he continued, suddenly remembering
something. &#8220;What&#8217;s the sheriff up to now? Is
he going to have a picnic out on Crawford&#8217;s ranch?
He asked me if he could have the lend of the
stage on an off day some time soon. Wants me to
drive it for him out to the A-Y and back. I don&#8217;t
know what his game is, and I don&#8217;t care none. I&#8217;ll
do it, all right. But what&#8217;s he going to do out
there, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake laughed: &#8220;Oh, nothing bad, I reckon.
You&#8217;ll probably learn all about it as soon as the
rest of us. How do you expect me to know anything
about it? Mebby he is going to have a
picnic out there for all we know. The A-Y is a
good place for one, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You just bet it is,&#8221; cried Bill. &#8220;Your ranch
is all right, Blake, but I like the A-Y better. It&#8217;s
got windmills and everything. Finest grove near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span>
the ranch-house that I ever saw, and I&#8217;ve seen some
fine groves in my time. Old man Crawford knew
a good thing when he saw it, all right. Here
comes Charley Winter like he had all day to go
nowhere&#8211;he&#8217;s got a good job with the Cross
Bar-8, but I wouldn&#8217;t have it for a gift&#8211;no, sir,
money wouldn&#8217;t tempt me to be one of that outfit.
But I reckon it&#8217;s some better out there than it once
was since the sheriff and The Orphant amputated
its inflamed fingers. Hullo, Charley,&#8221; he cried as
the newcomer drew rein. &#8220;I was just telling Blake
what a good job you have got with Sneed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, you old one-hoss driver,&#8221; grinned Charley.
&#8220;Hullo, Tom,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Looking for the
sheriff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Charley,&#8221; said the foreman, shaking
hands with Sneed&#8217;s substitute puncher. &#8220;Yes, I
am. Do you know where he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out at the Cross Bar-8, giving Sneed a
talking to,&#8221; Charley answered. &#8220;Bucknell went
and got loaded again last night, raised h&#8211;l in
town and out of it all the way home. He thought
he wanted to shoot up The Orphan, so he was some
primed. Jim is telling Sneed to hold him down to
water and peace unless he wants to lose him. He&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336'></a>336</span>
be in soon, though. How&#8217;s The Orphan getting
on out at your place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; answered Blake, his face wearing a
frown. &#8220;But I&#8217;m some sorry about that fool
Bucknell, though. He may get on a spree some
day and <i>find</i> The Orphan. I don&#8217;t want any more
gunplay, and if that idiot does find him and gets
ambitious to notch up his gun another hole, there&#8217;ll
shore be some loose lead. If he ever gets on
Star C ground, and I catch him there, I&#8217;ll shore
enough wipe up the earth with him, and when you
see him, just tell him what I said, will you? It
ain&#8217;t no joke, for I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore I&#8217;ll tell him,&#8221; replied Charley. &#8220;When
will that bunch of cattle be on hand&#8211;I&#8217;m anxious
to swap jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake flashed him a warning glance and tried
to ignore the question by changing the subject, but
it was too late, for Bill was curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;What cattle is that, Charley?&#8221; asked the
driver in sudden interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, some cattle that I&#8217;m going to get of Blake
for Sneed,&#8221; lied Charley easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in all get out does Sneed want with any
Star C cows?&#8221; Bill asked in surprise. &#8220;He&#8217;s got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>
plenty of cows of his own, unless The Orphant
shot a whole lot more than I thought he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Bill,&#8221; replied Charley. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t ask him, it being plainly none of my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill scratched his head: &#8220;No, I reckon not,&#8221; he
replied doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes Shields now,&#8221; said Blake suddenly.
&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll ride off and meet him. So long,
Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; replied Bill. &#8220;Be sure to tell The
Orphan I was asking about him. So long, Charley.&#8221;
He turned abruptly and entered the stage
office: &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something in the wind that I can&#8217;t get
onto nohow. He has shore got me guessing some,
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk tossed aside the paper and stared:
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s too d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d bad, now ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; he
asked sarcastically. &#8220;You ought to object, that&#8217;s
what you ought to do! What right has anybody
to keep quiet about their own business when you
want to know, hey? If I wanted to know everybody&#8217;s
business as bad as you do, I&#8217;d shore raise
h&#8211;l, I would. Why don&#8217;t you choke it out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span>
him, wipe up the earth with him? Go out right
now and give him a piece of your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you would, would you! You&#8217;re blamed
smart, now ain&#8217;t you? You work too hard&#8211;your
nerves are giving away,&#8221; drawled Bill as he
picked up the paper. &#8220;Sitting around all day with
your feet on the table and a pipe in your mouth
that you&#8217;re too lazy to light, working like the very
devil trying to find time to do the company&#8217;s business,
which there ain&#8217;t none to do. Ain&#8217;t you
ashamed to go to bed?&#8211;it must take a lot of gall
to hunt your rest at night after finding it and hugging
it all day. What would you do for a living
if I forgot to bring the paper with me some day,
hey? You ain&#8217;t got enough animation to want to
know what is going on in this little world of ours,
you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You get out of here, right now, too!&#8221; yelled
the clerk. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you hanging around bothering
me, you pest! Get out of here right now,
before I get up and throw you out! Do you
hear me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill crossed his legs, pushed back his sombrero,
turned the page carefully and then remarked, &#8220;I
licked four husky cow-punchers, real bad men, last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span>
month. One right after the other, and I was
purty near all in, too.&#8221; He glanced at the next
page disinterestedly, spat at a fly on the edge of
the box cuspidor and then added wearily and with
great deprecation, &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling fine to-day, never
felt so good in my life, but I need more exercise&#8211;I&#8217;m
two pounds over weight right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk showed interest and awe: &#8220;Weight?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;What is your fighting weight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill looked up aggressively: &#8220;Fighting weight?&#8221;
he asked, raising his eyebrows. &#8220;My <i>fighting</i>
weight is something over nine hundred pounds,
when I&#8217;m real mad. Ordinarily, one hundred and
eighty. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; replied the clerk, staring out
of the window.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ORPHAN GOES TO THE A-Y</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE A-Y had been a very busy place for the past two weeks because of the
cattle which had to be re-branded and taken
care of, and of other things which had to be done
about the ranch. The sheriff had taken title and
had persuaded Crawford to remain in nominal
charge for a month at the most so as to keep the
sale a secret until the new owner would be ready
to make it known. So word went around that
Crawford had hired the sheriff to put things on a
paying basis and that half of the old outfit had
left, their places being filled by Charley, the two
Larkin brothers and two men from a northern
ranch.</p>

<p>Shields had been very much pleased with the
cattle which The Orphan had bought for him and
had asked Blake if he could borrow the new
puncher to help him get things in good running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341'></a>341</span>
shape. Blake had told The Orphan of the sheriff&#8217;s
request and had advised him to accept, which
the puncher was very glad to do. So this is how the
former outlaw became temporary foreman of the
A-Y under the sheriff. Only the sheriff&#8217;s most intimate
friends knew his plans, one of whom was
Charley Winter, who found food for mirth in the
unique position things had taken. The sheriff&#8217;s
deputies who had lain out-doors all night on the
Cross Bar-8 waiting to capture or kill the outlaw
were now working under him, and the best of feelings
prevailed. The man who had hunted The
Orphan now employed him as the bearer of the
responsibilities of the new ranch. Truly, a change!</p>

<p>While The Orphan was busy with his duties on
the A-Y the sheriff rode to the Star C and sought
out the foreman, whom he finally found engaged
in freeing a cow that had become mired in a quicksand.
As the terror-stricken animal galloped
wildly away from the scene of torture and indignities
to its person Blake mopped his face and began
to scrape the quicksand from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Playing life-saver, eh?&#8221; laughed the sheriff.</p>

<p>The foreman looked up and smiled sheepishly:
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied as he shook hands with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span>
sheriff. &#8220;One cow more or less won&#8217;t make nor
break no ranch, but I just can&#8217;t see &#8217;em suffer.
The boys and I were passing, so we stopped and
got to work. But cows ain&#8217;t got no gratitude, not
nohow! That ornery beast will be all ready to
charge me the first time he sees me afoot. Did you
see him try to horn me when I let go?&#8221;</p>

<p>His friend laughed, and when they had ridden
some distance from the others he turned in his
saddle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, The Orphan is working like a horse,
and he likes it, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You ought to hear
him giving orders&#8211;he just asks a man to do a
thing, don&#8217;t order it done. When he talks it sounds
like the puncher would be doing him the greatest
possible favor to do the work he is paid to do, but
there is a suggestion that if any nastiness develops,
hell will be a peaceful place compared to the near
vicinity of the foreman of the A-Y. He sizes up
a thing with one look, and then tells how it should
be done. Everything has gone off so fine that
I&#8217;m going to ask you to lose a good man, and
real soon, too. What do you say, Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake laughed: &#8220;Why, we were a-plenty before
he came and we&#8217;ll be a-plenty after he goes. That&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span>
for your asking me to turn him over to you. The
boys will be both sorry and glad to have him leave,
because they like him a whole lot. But of course
they want to see him land everything that he can,
so they&#8217;ll give him a good send-off. That reminds
me to say that I know they will want to be on hand
when you break the news to him. It&#8217;ll be a circus
for your Eastern friend, Miss Ritchie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking!&#8221; enthused the sheriff.
&#8220;I want to have as many fireworks at the ceremony
as I can possibly get. Oh, it&#8217;ll be a great day, all
right. We are all going out and take a bang-up
lunch, just like we&#8217;re going on that picnic that Bill&#8217;s
been so worried about, and Bill is going to drive
the women over in his coach. The first surprise
will be the announcement of the new ownership
of the A-Y, and right on top of it I&#8217;m going to fire
the second gun. I hope none of your boys know
anything about it,&#8221; he added with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; hastily replied the foreman.
&#8220;You have your wife send a message to me by Joe
when he rustles our mail to-morrow and ask us to
come to the picnic at the A-Y on the day which
you will decide on. They&#8217;ll go, all right, no fear
about that. Nothing more than your wife&#8217;s cooking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>
is needed to attract them,&#8221; and he laughed
heartily at how suddenly they would come to life
at such a summons.</p>

<p>Shields thought intently for a few seconds and
then slapped his thigh: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; he exulted.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride over to your place with you and write
a letter to my wife telling her just what to do. Joe
can deliver it and bring back the invitation. You
see, I won&#8217;t be home to-night, but that will do the
trick, all right. Now, what do you say to this
coming Saturday?&#8211;this is, let me see: Wednesday.
Will that be time enough for you to make any
arrangements you may want to make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore, plenty of time,&#8221; Blake laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s
good all the way. Joe will be delighted to have
a real good excuse to call at your house. He&#8217;s a
bashful cuss, like all the rest. They talk big, but
they&#8217;re some bashful all the same. He&#8217;s been
worrying about it, for one day he came to me with
a funny expression on his face and acted like he
didn&#8217;t know how to begin. So I asked him what
was troubling him, and he blurted out like this, as
near as I can remember:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, you know Mrs. Shields said we was to
go to her house when any of us hit town?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span>&#8220;&#8216;I shore do,&#8217; I answered, wondering what
was up.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, I go to town a lot, and it takes a h&#8211;l
of a lot of gall to do it,&#8217; he complained, looking
so serious that it was funny.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gall!&#8217; said I, surprised-like, and trying to
keep my face straight. &#8216;Gall! Well, I can&#8217;t see
that it takes such a brave man to call at a friend&#8217;s
house when he&#8217;s been told to do it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, that part of it is all right,&#8221; he replied.
&#8216;But she&#8217;ll think I only call to get my face fed, and
it makes me feel like a&#8211;I don&#8217;t know what. You
see, I always get away quick.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, stay longer, there ain&#8217;t no use of being
in a hurry,&#8217; I said. &#8216;Stay and talk a while.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then they&#8217;ll think I ain&#8217;t got enough and
push more pie at me, like they did once,&#8217; he complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Suppose I give Silent your terrible ordeal to
do,&#8217; I suggested tentatively, &#8216;or Bud, he&#8217;s dead
anxious for your job.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, it ain&#8217;t as bad as that!&#8217; he cried quickly.
&#8216;I only thought that I&#8217;d speak to you about it. I
thought you could suggest something.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; I replied, &#8216;every time you call you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>
say I sent you over to ask about the sheriff&#8217;s health.
How&#8217;ll that do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He grinned sheepishly and then swore:
&#8216;H&#8211;l, that would make a shore enough mess
of it,&#8217; he cried. &#8216;I&#8217;d be a royal American idiot to
say a thing like that, now, wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff laughed heartily, and they talked
about the picnic until they had reached the ranch-house,
where he wrote the note to his wife. Bidding
his friend good-by, he rode out past the
corrals and headed for the A-Y.</p>

<p>When about half-way to his own ranch, and on
A-Y ground, he surmounted a rise and saw a figure
flit from sight behind a thicket, and his curiosity
was immediately aroused. Not knowing who the
man might be, he stalked his quarry and finally
found Bucknell standing beside his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the trouble now?&#8221; the sheriff
asked as he came out into sight. He was dangerously
near angry, for Bucknell was on forbidden
ground and was flushed as if from liquor.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>Bucknell looked confused: &#8220;Nothing, Sheriff.
Why?&#8221; he asked, evading the searching gaze of
the peace officer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span>&#8220;Oh, I thought something might have gone
wrong on the Cross Bar-8, and that you were looking
for me,&#8221; Shields coldly replied.</p>

<p>Bucknell looked at the ground and coughed nervously
before he replied, which only made the sheriff
all the more determined to get at the matter in a
true light.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; replied the puncher.
&#8220;I was just riding out this way&#8211;I was some nervous,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t go with me!&#8221; the sheriff said
sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived too long to bite on a yarn
like that. Why, you can&#8217;t look at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The puncher did not reply and the sheriff
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Bucknell, take some good
advice from me&#8211;stay on your ranch, mind your
own business and let liquor alone. As sure as you
monkey around the Star C Blake will give you a
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n sound licking, and he&#8217;s man enough to do
it, too, make no error. And as for the A-Y, well,
the temporary foreman of that ranch is the cleverest
man with a gun that I ever saw, and I&#8217;ve seen
some good ones in my time. If you go up against
him you&#8217;ll get shot, for he&#8217;d think you were about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span>
the easiest proposition he ever met. As sure as you
drink you&#8217;ll get drunk, and as sure as you get drunk
you&#8217;ll work up an appetite for a fight, and if you
pick a fight with him you&#8217;ll never know what hit
you. You stick to water and the Cross Bar-8.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon I can take care of my own business,&#8221;
sullenly replied Bucknell. &#8220;I can come out
here drunk or sober if I wants to, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do nothing of the kind,&#8221; rejoined
the sheriff. &#8220;And you certainly ought to be able
to take care of your own business, as you say,&#8221; he
retorted, holding his temper with an effort. &#8220;But
in the past you didn&#8217;t, and you may not in the
future. And when your business gets too big for
you to handle it gets into my hands, and if you
make any trouble I&#8217;ll d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n soon convince you
that I can handle your surplus. Now, get out of
here and think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bucknell swung into his saddle and then turned,
the liquor making him reckless.</p>

<p>&#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The Orphant killed
Jimmy and a whole lot more good cow-punchers!
He&#8217;s nothing but a murdering thief, a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d
rustler, that&#8217;s what he is! And you are his best
friend, it seems!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span>The wan smile flickered across the sheriff&#8217;s face,
but still he refrained, for such is the foolish consideration
given by brave men to liquor. A drunkard
may do much with impunity, for the argument
states he is not responsible, forgetting that in the
beginning he was responsible enough to have left
liquor alone, and that injury, whether unintentional
or not, is still injury.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no seem about it!&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I
<i>am</i> his best friend, and he needs friends bad enough,
God knows. But speaking of murder, those four
good cow-punchers that stopped me in the defile
tried hard enough to qualify at it, and The Orphan
not only saved me, but also some of them, for I&#8217;d
a gotten some of them before I cashed. You&#8217;re
a h&#8211;l of a fine cub to talk about murders, you
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; retorted Bucknell, &#8220;he&#8217;s
just what I said he was. And a side pardner of
our brave sheriff, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you!&#8221; shouted Shields, his face dark
with passion. &#8220;You have said enough, any more
from you and I&#8217;ll break your dirty neck! Just
because I felt sorry for you when you got half
killed in the saloon and let you stay in the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>
don&#8217;t think you are the boss of this section. When
I saw what a pitiful, drunken wreck you were, I
felt sorry for you, but not any more. You don&#8217;t
want decent treatment, you want to get clubbed,
and you&#8217;re right in line to get just what you need,
too! Now, I&#8217;m not going to stand any more of
your d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d foolishness&#8211;my patience is played
out. And if you were half a man you wouldn&#8217;t
sit there like a bump on a log and swallow what
I&#8217;m saying&#8211;you&#8217;d put up a fight if you died for it.
You are no good, just a drunken, lawless fool of
a puncher; just a bag of wind, and it&#8217;s up to you
to walk a chalk line or I&#8217;ll give you a taste of what
I carry around with me for bums of your kind.
What in h&#8211;l do you think I am? No, you
don&#8217;t, you stay right where you are &#8217;til I get good
and ready to have you go! You&#8217;ve come d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d
near the end of your rope and there is just one
thing for you to do, and that is, get out of this
country and do it quick! You stay on your own
side of the Limping Water, for if I catch you riding
off any nervousness off of Cross Bar-8 ground
without word from your foreman, I&#8217;ll shoot you
down like I&#8217;d shoot a coyote! And for a dollar
I&#8217;d wipe up the earth with you right now! You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span>
d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>d, sneaking, cowardly cur, you tin-horn
bully! Pull your stakes and get scarce and don&#8217;t
you open your mouth to me&#8211;come on, lively!
Pull your freight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bucknell slowly rode away, his eyes to the
ground and not daring to say what seethed in his
heart. He swore to himself that he would get
square some day on both, not realizing in his anger
that when sober he feared them both.</p>

<p>The sheriff stared after him and then returned
to the point where he had left his horse. As he
mounted he shook his head savagely and swore.
Glancing again after the puncher he struck into a
canter and rode toward the ranch.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352'></a>352</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>BILL ATTENDS THE PICNIC</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE picnic aroused quite a stir for so frivolous a thing. When Blake
read Mrs. Shields&#8217; invitation to the outfit they acted
like schoolboys dismissed for a vacation. Grins of
delight were the style on the Star C, and the overflow
of bubbling happiness took the form of practical
joking against Humble, whose life suddenly
held much anxiety. In Ford&#8217;s Station there was
an air of expectancy, and Bill spent all of Saturday
morning from daylight until time to start in cleaning
his stage and grooming the horses, whose
astonishment quickly passed into prohibitive indignation.
After narrowly escaping broken bones
and chewed arms Bill decided that the sextet could
go as it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serves &#8217;em right!&#8221; he yelled to his friendly
enemy, the clerk, after he had barely dodged a
vicious kick, wildly waving a curry comb. &#8220;Let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353'></a>353</span>
the ignoramuses go like they are! Let &#8217;em show
how cheap and common they are! They never was
any good for anything, anyhow, eating their heads
off and kicking their best friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the time they beat out them
Apaches?&#8221; asked the clerk, settling back comfortably
against the coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get out!&#8221; yelled Bill pugnaciously.
&#8220;Who asked you for talk, hey? And get away
from that coach, you idiot, you&#8217;ll dirty it all up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sic &#8217;em, Tige!&#8221; jeered the clerk pleasantly.
&#8220;Chew &#8217;em up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; yelled Bill, swiftly grabbing up the
pail of water which stood near him. &#8220;Sic &#8217;em,
is it!&#8221; he cried, running forward. &#8220;Chew &#8217;em
up, hey!&#8221; he continued, heaving the contents of the
pail at the clerk, who nimbly sprang inside the vehicle
and slammed the door shut behind him as the
water struck it. He leaped out of the other door
and was safely away before Bill realized what had
happened. Then the driver said things when he
saw the mess he had made of the coach, upon
which he had spent two hard hours in polishing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suffering dogs!&#8221; he shouted, dancing first on
one foot and then on the other. &#8220;Now look what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span>
you&#8217;ve done! You&#8217;re a h&#8211;l of a feller, you are!
After me rubbing the skin off&#8217;n my hands and
breaking my arms a-polishing it up! You good
for nothing, mangy half-breed! Wait till I get a
hold of you, you long pair of legs, you! Just
wait! I&#8217;ll show you, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk twiddled his fingers from afar and
jeered in his laughter: &#8220;Serves you right! Sic &#8217;em,
Towser! Eat &#8217;em up, Fido! Sic &#8217;em, sic &#8217;em!&#8221;
he shouted joyously, and forthwith ran for his life.</p>

<p>Bill returned to the coach and worked like mad
to undo the evil effects he had wrought and finally
succeeded in bringing a phantom glow to the time-battered
wood. Then he hitched up and drove to
the sheriff&#8217;s house, where he saw huge baskets on
the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mrs. Shields,&#8221; he said as he
stamped to the door. &#8220;Good morning, ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning William,&#8221; replied the sheriff&#8217;s
wife as she hurried to collect shawls and blankets.
&#8220;Will you mind putting those baskets on the coach,
William? We will soon be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly not, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he answered,
recklessly grabbing up the two largest. &#8220;Jimminee!&#8221;
he exulted. &#8220;These are shore heavy, all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span>
right, all right! Must be plumb full of good
things! To-day is where your Uncle Bill Halloway
gets square for the dinner the company froze
him out of. Wonder if there&#8217;s apricot pie in this
one?&#8221; he mused curiously. He gingerly raised the
cover and a grin distorted his face. &#8220;Must be six,
yes, eight&#8211;mebby ten!&#8221; he soliloquized as he
placed it on the stage. &#8220;Hullo, bottles of some
kind,&#8221; he whispered as he picked up another basket.
&#8220;Hear the little devils clink, eh? Must be
coffee and tea, hey? Yes, shore enough it is. Good
Lord, how hungry I am&#8211;wish I had eaten that
breakfast this morning&#8211;how in thunder did I know
we was going to be so late? I&#8217;ll be the strong man
at this picnic, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are some blankets, William,&#8221; called Mrs.
Shields. &#8220;Helen, would you mind showing him
how to carry that box?&#8211;he&#8217;s sure to turn it upside
down if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next!&#8221; he cried, returning from the trip with
the blankets. &#8220;I put them blankets up on top,
Mrs. Shields, is it all right? How do you do,
Miss Helen, any more freight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;This box
is to go, please. Now, do be very careful not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>
turn it up, or jar it!&#8221; she warned. &#8220;And put it
on the seat inside the coach where we can steady it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, what&#8217;s in it?&#8221; asked Bill, nearly dying
from his curiosity. &#8220;Must be the joker of the
feast, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three layer cakes,&#8221; she laughingly replied.
&#8220;Chocolate, cocoanut and lemon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll carry this one high up,
it deserves it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do be careful!&#8221; she cried as he swooped
it up to his shoulder. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she screamed as it
thumped against the top of the door frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa! Back up!&#8221; cried Bill, executing the
order. &#8220;Easy, boy&#8211;all right, off we go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grace, Mary,&#8221; cried Helen, &#8220;we are all ready
to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t there any more boxes?&#8221; asked Bill from
the coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, girls,&#8221; cried Mrs. Shields as she stepped
into the coach. &#8220;Close the door after you, and
lock it, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill gallantly helped the ladies into the coach,
grinned at the cake box and started toward the
front wheel when he was called back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, William,&#8221; cautioned Mrs. Shields,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>
laughing. &#8220;We will not be pursued by Apaches
to-day, and this cake must not be shaken!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t know you&#8217;re riding, ma&#8217;am, you
shore won&#8217;t,&#8221; he assured her as he danced toward
the front wheel again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up there, you!&#8221; he yelled from the box.
&#8220;Come on, Jerry, think you&#8217;re glued to the earth?
Come on, Tom! Easy there, you fool jackrabbit!
&#8211;haven&#8217;t you learned that you can&#8217;t reach this
high!&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had arrived at the A-Y the baskets
were carried into the ranch-house and the women
became very busy getting things ready for the feast.
Bill took care of his team and then carried the
blankets to the grove.</p>

<p>While the picnic was being prepared there arose
a series of blood-curdling whoops off to the south
where the outfit of the Star C made the air blue
with powder smoke. As they came nearer something
peculiar was noticed by Helen. It appeared
to be a sort of drag drawn by a horse and supported
by two long, springy poles, one end of which rested
on the ground, and the other fastened to the saddle.
While she wondered Bill came up and she
turned to him for light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358'></a>358</span>&#8220;What have they got fastened to that horse?&#8221;
she asked him.</p>

<p>He looked and then smiled: &#8220;Why, it is a
travois,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But what under the sun have
they got on it? They must be bringing their own
grub!&#8221;</p>

<p>The travois dragged and bumped over the uneven
plain and soon came near enough for its
burden to be made out. A man and a dog were
strapped to it.</p>

<p>At this point Blake joined Helen and Bill, and
as he did so he espied the travois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunder!&#8221; he cried, running forward.
&#8220;Somebody is hurt! What&#8217;s the matter, Silent?&#8221;
he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter?&#8221; asked Silent, in surprise as the outfit
drew near. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t nothing the matter.
Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that travois doing with you, then?&#8221;
Blake demanded.</p>

<p>Silent&#8217;s face was as grave as that of an owl.
&#8220;Travois?&#8221; he asked. Then his face cleared:
&#8220;Oh, yes&#8211;I near forgot about it,&#8221; he added, apologetically.
&#8220;You see, Humble he shore wanted
his dog to come to the picnic, so we reckoned we&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359'></a>359</span>
let it come along. Bud and Jim was for slinging it
at the end of a rope and dragging it over, but I
said no. We ain&#8217;t got any ropes to have all frayed
out and cut a-dragging dogs to picnics, and I said
so, too. So we built the travois and strapped Lightning
to it. When Humble saw what we had done
he acted real unpolite. He said as how he wasn&#8217;t
going to have no dog of his&#8217;n toted twenty miles
in a fool travois. Said that he&#8217;d make it stay home
first, which was some mean after inviting the dog
to come along. He said that he&#8217;d go in a travois
himself first before he&#8217;d let the setter be made a
fool of. Well, we simply had to subdue him, and
he got so unreasonable that we just had to tie him
with his dog. He shore does get awful pig-headed
at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take off the gag, Jim,&#8221; requested Silent, turning
to the grinning cow-puncher. &#8220;Let him loose
now, we&#8217;ve arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim leaned over and whispered in Humble&#8217;s ear,
the information being that there were ladies about,
and that all swearing must be thought and not
yelled. Then he slipped the gag, and untied the
ropes. Gales of laughter met the angry and indignant
puncher when he had leaped to his feet, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span>
he flashed one quick glance at the women and then,
boiling with wrath and suppressed profanity, fled
toward the corrals as swiftly as cramped muscles
would allow. The dog snarled at its tormentors
and then set off in hot pursuit of its discomfited
master, whose waving arms kept time with his
speeding legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all the thanks we get,&#8221; grumbled Bud,
&#8220;but then, he don&#8217;t know any better anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake laughed and regarded his grinning and
expectant outfit, and the longer he looked at them
the more he laughed. They had paid their respects
to the women while Silent explained about the
travois and now they cast many longing glances at
the blankets and cloths spread out on the grass and
at the baskets which Bill was busy over. They had
tried to coax the driver to them to give information
as to what they might expect in the way of edibles,
but he had haughtily and disdainfully refused to
enlighten them, taking care, however, to arouse
their curiosity by looking fondly at the box and the
baskets and even showed his elation by taking
several fancy steps for their benefit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, get rid of the cayuses,&#8221; said Blake,
&#8220;and square things with Humble. Bring him back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span>
with you or you don&#8217;t get any pie. You&#8217;re such a
darn fool crowd that I can&#8217;t get mad this time,
but don&#8217;t ever drag a man in a travois again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he come, or was he kidnapped?&#8221; murmured
Bud. &#8220;What we did once we can do again,
and Humble will be on hand when the feast
begins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim had been scowling at Bill, whose manners
were most aggravating. &#8220;You just wait, you
heathen,&#8221; threatened Jim. &#8220;You&#8217;re ace high with
the grub, all right, but just you wait &#8217;til we get you
alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah!&#8221; laughed the driver. &#8220;I shore can
handle the best cow-wrastler that ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill seems to be running this here festival,&#8221;
Bud complained to Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is our right-hand man,&#8221; she replied
with enthusiasm. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t possibly get along
without him, now. He has charge of the pie and
cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s chest expanded: &#8220;I&#8217;m foreman of the pie
and cake herd,&#8221; he exclaimed proudly. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t get ahead of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bud looked at the driver and then significantly
waved his hand at the travois: &#8220;And you&#8217;ll shore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span>
travel in style, just like a real pie foreman, too,
when we gets a chance to honor you like we
wants to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get no pie if you acts smart, little boy,&#8221;
retorted the driver. &#8220;Run along and play till
lunch is ready, and don&#8217;t dirty your hands and
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got fine memories,&#8221; Bud suggested
as he led the way to the corrals, where
he found The Orphan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Orphan!&#8221; he cried enthusiastically as
he gripped the outstretched hand. &#8220;Plumb glad
to see you. How&#8217;s things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, boys,&#8221; cried the temporary
foreman, who was all smiles. &#8220;One at a time!&#8221;
he laughed as they crowded about him. &#8220;Make
yourselves right at home&#8211;that smallest corral is
for your cayuses. And you&#8217;ll find plenty of soap
and water and towels by the bunk-house, and there&#8217;s
a box of good cigars, a tin of tobacco, and a jug on
the table inside. Help yourself to anything you
want, the place is all yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, this is a good game, all right,&#8221; Bud
laughed as he turned to put his horse in the corral.
&#8220;The sheriff shore knows how to deal.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363'></a>363</span>&#8220;Leave a cigar for me, Silent,&#8221; jokingly warned
Jim as his friend turned toward the bunk-house.
&#8220;Too many smokes will make you sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got a gall, all right!&#8221; retorted
Silent. &#8220;You better let me bring yours out to
you and keep away from the box, for I&#8217;m always
plumb suspicious of these goody-goody, it&#8217;s-for-your-own-good
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>A crafty look came to Jack Lawson&#8217;s face and
he turned to The Orphan: &#8220;Has Bill Howland
got his cigars yet?&#8221; he asked, winking at his
friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know whether he has or not,&#8221;
replied The Orphan. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe that
he has been out of sight of the pies since he came.
They&#8217;ve got him in a trance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll take him one,&#8221; continued Jack, grinning
broadly. &#8220;He likes to smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore enough, go ahead,&#8221; endorsed the foreman
of the A-Y as he turned toward the grove.
Then he stopped, and with a knowing look added:
&#8220;If you want to see Humble, he just went in the
bunk-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>A yell of dismay arose as the outfit started pell-mell
for the house. Silent entered it first and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span>
profanity informed his companions that their fears
were well grounded. Neither Humble, cigars,
tobacco nor jug were to be seen, and a search was
forthwith instituted. Jack looked at a distant corral
and saw Lightning as the dog disappeared from
sight into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;He&#8217;s in the big corral&#8211;I
just saw his dog go in, and it was wagging its
tail a whole lot. Come on, we&#8217;ll surround it and
show that frisky gent a thing or two!&#8221;</p>

<p>No more words were wasted, and in a very short
time figures were creeping around the corral. Then
there was a scramble as most of the searchers scaled
the wall at different points while two of them ran
in through the gate. The first thing they saw was
the dog, and his tail was still wagging as he
curiously followed, nose to the ground, a huge
horned toad. He looked up at the sudden disturbance
and backed off suspiciously, looking for a way
to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span> <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!&#8221; chorused the fooled punchers,
who discovered that deductions don&#8217;t always deduct,
and then they returned to the bunk-house to
&#8220;slick up.&#8221; When finally satisfied about their
appearance they made their way to the grove and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span>
the sight which greeted their eyes as they entered
it almost made them drop in their tracks.</p>

<p>Humble and Bill sat cross-legged on a blanket,
which was surrounded with guns. The jug, tobacco
and cigars were flanked by pies and a cake, while
each of the conspirators held a lighted cigar in one
hand while they took turns at the jug. A huge
piece of pie rested in a plate at Humble&#8217;s side,
while Bill&#8217;s knee held a piece of cake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; shouted Humble, grabbing a
gun. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare to raid the gallery! You
stay right where you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s blacksnake whip leaped from point to point
experimentally, picking up twigs and leaves with
disturbing accuracy.</p>

<p>The invaders halted just beyond the range of
the whip and consulted uneasily, not noticing that
the driver had shortened his weapon by twice the
length of its handle. Finally Jim and Docile ran
back toward the corral while their friends waited
impatiently for their return, grinning at the enemy
with an I-told-you-so air.</p>

<p>Bill suddenly leaned forward, the whip slid down
into his hand to the end of the handle and cracked
viciously. Joe Haines, who had grown a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span>
careless, leaped into the air and yelled, grabbing
at his leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your distance, you!&#8221; warned the driver,
trying to look ferocious. &#8220;Twenty feet is the
dead-line, children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim and Docile returned apace and brought with
them half a dozen lariats, which ranged in length
from thirty to forty feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you!&#8221; cried Humble in alarm. &#8220;That
ain&#8217;t fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grim silence was the only reply as the invaders
each took his rope and surrounded the two. Then,
suddenly, the air was full of darting ropes and in
less time than it takes to tell of it the pair were
hopelessly and helplessly trussed. Silent ran in and
hurled the whip away and then squatted before
the prisoners, throwing their cigars after the whip
as he took up the pie and cake, which he tantalizingly
munched before their eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like a hog, all right, but you suit me too
blamed well!&#8221; asserted Bud, grabbing at Silent&#8217;s
pie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme some of that,&#8221; demanded Jim, trying
for the cake. And when the disturbance had ceased
there were no signs of either pie or cake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367'></a>367</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the travois for you, Humble dear!&#8221; softly
hummed Charley Bailey. &#8220;And to the ranch, by
the way of town!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Bill will be pleased to explore the Limping
Water on the bottom,&#8221; amended Jim. &#8220;One
of us can drive the women home!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ANNOUNCEMENT</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>A</span>BOUT thirty people sat in a circle on the grass in the grove on the A-Y,
engaged in taking viands from the well-filled plates
which made the rounds. Keen humor from all
sides kept them in roars of laughter, Humble and
Bill provoking the greater part of it. Humble sat
next to Miss Ritchie, while The Orphan and Bill
flanked Helen, the sheriff next to his new foreman.
Humble&#8217;s face had a look of benign condescension
when he allowed himself to bestow perfunctory
attentions on the members of his outfit, whom he
graciously called &#8220;purty fair punchers in a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crawford, the former owner of the A-Y, sat
next to Shields, and when the lunch had reached
the cigar stage he arose and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen, Bill and Humble,&#8221; he
began amid laughter. &#8220;I have been regarded as
the host of this picnic, and the false position embarrasses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369'></a>369</span>
me. But any such momentary feeling is
compensated by the importance of what I have to
tell you.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I took up the A-Y it was with a determination
to keep it and to spend the rest of my
days on it in peace. This I have found to be
impossible, and in consequence I have turned it
over to a better man. The energy which I have
seen applied in the right way for the last few
weeks has assured me that the A-Y will soon be
second in importance and wealth to no ranch in
this country. I have seen order, system, emerge
from chaos; I have seen five thousand cattle re-branded
and taken care of in such dispatch as to
astonish me and be almost beyond my belief. The
sheriff has been as economical in the use of his
energy as he can be in the use of his words. By
that I don&#8217;t mean in the way that is causing you to
smile, but simply that he knows how to accomplish
the most work with the least possible expenditure
of effort and time, as witnessed by the condition
of this ranch to-day. But while he has been the
guiding spirit in the work of putting the ranch
on its proper footing, he has had as good assistants
as it is possible to find.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370'></a>370</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to tire you with any long speech,
for brevity is the soul of more than wit, so I will
close by telling you that the A-Y is in new and
better hands&#8211;our sheriff is now its owner, and I
extend to him my heartiest wishes for his success
in his new venture. I must thank him and all of
you for a very pleasant day and a memory to take
East with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant there was intense silence, and
then a small battle seemed to be taking place. The
noise of the shooting and cheering was deafening
and smoke rolled down like a heavy fog. The
sheriff met the rush toward him and put in a very
busy few minutes in shaking hands and replying
to the hearty congratulations which poured in
upon him from all sides. Everybody was happy
and all were talking at once, and Bill could be
heard reeling off an unbroken string of words at
high speed.</p>

<p>The Orphan fought his way to his best friend
and gripped both hands in his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, Sheriff!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;This is great
news, and I&#8217;m plumb glad to hear it! I hope you
have the very best of luck and that your returns,
both in pleasure and money, far exceed your fondest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span>
expectations. Anything I can do is yours for
the asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, son,&#8221; replied the sheriff, looking
fondly into his friend&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to call
on you just as soon as I can make myself heard in
all this hellabaloo. Just listen to that!&#8221; he exclaimed
as Silent let loose again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; yelled he of the misleading name,
slapping Humble across the back. &#8220;For this you
ride home like a white man, Humble&#8211;all your
sins are forgiven! Hurrah for the sheriff, his
family and the A-Y!&#8221; he shouted at the top of his
lungs, and his cheer was supported unanimously
with true cowboy enthusiasm and vim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray for me, too!&#8221; shouted Bill in laughter.
Then he fled, with Silent in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>The sheriff tried to speak, and after several
attempts was finally given silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, everybody!&#8221; he cried, his face
beaming. &#8220;I am happy for many reasons to-day,
but foremost among them is the fact that I have
so many warm and loyal friends. The A-Y is
always open to all of you, and I&#8217;ll be some disappointed
if you don&#8217;t put in a lot of your spare
time over here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span>He paused for a few seconds and then looked
at The Orphan, who stood at Helen&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crawford did his part a whole lot better
than I can do mine, I&#8217;m afraid, but I&#8217;m going
to do my best, anyhow. The news has only been
half told&#8211;the name of the new foreman of the
A-Y henceforth will be The Orphan! Whoop
her up, boys!&#8221; he shouted, leading a cheer which
was not one whit less a cheer than those which
had gone before.</p>

<p>The Orphan stared in astonishment, for once
in his life he had been surprised. The sheriff at
last had the drop on him. He looked from one
to another, started to step forward and then
changed his mind and looked appealingly at Helen,
who smiled in a way to double the speed of his
heart-beats.</p>

<p>Her eyes were moist, and the sudden consciousness
that she formed half of the objective of all
eyes caused her cheeks to go crimson. Her hand
impulsively went to his shoulder and without
thought on her part, and his incredulous questioning
was answered by her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all true,&#8221; she said earnestly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
of it for a whole week now. You are the real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373'></a>373</span>
foreman of the A-Y, and I most earnestly hope
for your success.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suddenly seemed to be above the earth and
his voice broke in his stammered reply. For a
fraction of a second her eyes had told him what
he had dreamed of, what he had hoped for above
all things, and he grasped her hand for a second
as he stepped forward toward his new employer,
whose hand met his with a man&#8217;s grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sheriff,&#8221; he said, his head whirling
from the surprises of a minute. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been
squarer and fairer with me than any man I&#8217;ve ever
known, and hell will look nice to me if I don&#8217;t
make good with you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, boys; thank you, Bill: you&#8217;re all
right, every one of you!&#8221; he cried as his friends
crowded about him. &#8220;What the sheriff said about
warm friends was the truth&#8211;thank you, Bud and
Jim! Thank you, Blake&#8211;you&#8217;re another brick!
Good God, what I have gained in two months! I
can scarcely believe it, it seems so like a dream.
That&#8217;s a real warm grip, all right, though,&#8221; he
exclaimed as he shook hands with Humble, &#8220;so I
reckon it&#8217;s all true. Two months!&#8221; he marveled.
&#8220;Two glorious, glorious months! A new start
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span>
in life, a loyal crowd of friends, a&#8211;and all in two
months! And there is the man I owe it all
to,&#8221; he suddenly cried, pointing to the sheriff.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the whitest man God ever made, and
I&#8217;ll kill the man who says I lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy!&#8221; shouted Bill in enthusiastic endorsement.
&#8220;You two make a pair of aces what
can beat any full-house ever got together, and <i>I</i>&#8217;ll
lick the man who says <i>I</i> lie!&#8221; he yelled pugnaciously.
&#8220;The Orphant may be an orphant, all
right, but he&#8217;s got a whole lot of brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Shields walked over to The Orphan and
placed a motherly hand on his shoulder as he
recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be an orphan any longer, my boy,&#8221;
she said, smiling up at him. &#8220;You&#8217;re one of us
now&#8211;I always wanted a son, and God has given
me one in you.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>TEX WILLIARD&#8217;S MISTAKE</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>D</span>URING the month which followed the picnic things ran smoothly on the
A-Y, and the rejuvenated ranch was the pride
of the whole contingent, from the sheriff down to
the cook. The Orphan had taken charge with a
determination which grew firmer with each passing
day and the new owner was delighted at the outcome
of his plans. The foreman, elated and
happy at his sudden shift in fortune, radiated
cheerfulness and consideration. His men knew
that he would not ask them to do anything which
he himself feared to do, which would not have
been much consolation to a timid man, since he
feared nothing; but to them it meant that they
had a foreman who would stick by them through
fire and water, and a foreman who commands
respect from his outfit is a man whose life is made
easy for him. He had known too much of unkindness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376'></a>376</span>
harshness, to become angry at mistakes; instead,
he set diligently at work to undo them, and
mistakes were rare. The very men who had once
wished for his life would now fight instantly to
save it. They were proud of him, of the owner,
the ranch and themeselves; and proudest of all was
Bill, once driver of the stage, but now a cowboy
working hard and loyally under the man who had
once held him up for a smoke.</p>

<p>Visitors were numerous, and every man who
called became enthusiastic about the ranch, and
after he had departed marveled at the complete
change in the man who was its foreman, and felt
confidence in the good judgment of the sheriff.
Ford&#8217;s Station was openly jubilant, for the town
exulted in the discomfiture of the Cross Bar-8 and
in the proof that their sheriff was right. And
Ford&#8217;s Station chuckled at the news it heard, for
the foreman of the Cross Bar-8 had called twice at
the A-Y and was fast losing his prejudice against
The Orphan. Sneed had found a quiet, optimistic
foreman in the place of his former enemy, and the
laughter which lurked in The Orphan&#8217;s eyes closed
the breach. He had seen the man in a new light,
and when he had said his farewell at the close of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span>
his second visit the grip of his hand was strong.
As for the Star C, a trail had been worn between
the two ranches and hardly a day passed but one
or more of its punchers dropped in to say a few
words to their former bunkmate, and to stir up
Bill. The Star C, no less than his own men, swore
by The Orphan.</p>

<p>One bright morning the sheriff left for a trip to
Chicago and other packing cities to arrange for
future cattle shipments, and announced that he
would be away for a week or two. On the night
following his departure trouble began. The ranch
and bunk houses of the Cross Bar-8 were fired
into, and when Sneed and his men had returned
after a fruitless search in the dark the foreman
stared at the wall and swore. Was it The Orphan
again? In the absence of the sheriff had he renewed
the war? First thought cried that he had,
but gradually the idea became untenable. Why
should The Orphan risk his splendid berth on the
A-Y, his prospects now rich in promise, to work
off any lingering hatred? When Sneed had shaken
hands with him he found apparent sincerity in the
warm clasp. He would ride over at daylight and
have the matter settled once and for all. And if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span>
satisfied that The Orphan was guiltless of the outrage
he would turn his whole attention to the imitator
of the former outlaw.</p>

<p>The Orphan was mending his saddle girth when
he saw Sneed cantering past the farthest corral.
The latter&#8217;s horse bore all the signs of hard riding
and he looked up inquiringly at the visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Sneed,&#8221; he said pleasantly,
arising and laying aside the saddle. &#8220;What&#8217;s up,
anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I came over to find out about it,&#8221;
Sneed answered. &#8220;I hardly know how to begin&#8211;but
here, I&#8217;ll tell it from the beginning,&#8221; and he
related what had occurred, much to the wonder of
The Orphan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; finished the visitor, &#8220;I want to ask
you a question, although I may be a d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n fool
for doing it. But I want to get this thing thrashed
out. Do you know who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman of the A-Y straightened up, his
eyes flashing, and then he realized that Sneed had
some right to question him after what had occurred
in the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sneed, I do not,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but in
two guesses I can name the man!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379'></a>379</span>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Sneed. &#8220;Go ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bucknell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he was with me in the bunk-house,&#8221; replied
the foreman of the Cross Bar-8. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
him&#8211;go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tex Williard,&#8221; said The Orphan with decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tex?&#8221; cried Sneed. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain as day, Sneed,&#8221; The Orphan answered.
&#8220;He&#8217;s sore at me, but lacks nerve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, thunderation, how would he hurt you by
shooting at us?&#8221; Sneed demanded, impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he would scare up a war during the sheriff&#8217;s
absence by throwing your suspicions on me.
He reckoned you would think that I did it, get
good and mad, fly off the handle and raise h&#8211;l
generally. He figured that I, according to the past,
would meet you half way and that you or some of
your men might kill me. If you didn&#8217;t, he reckoned
that the sheriff would kick me out of this
berth, and that one or both of us might get killed
in the argument. He could sit back and laugh to
himself at how easy it was to square up old scores
from a distance. It&#8217;s Tex as sure as I am here,
and unless Tex changes his plans and gets out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380'></a>380</span>
this country d<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n soon he won&#8217;t be long in getting
what he seems to ache for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed pushed back his sombrero and smiled
grimly: &#8220;I reckon that you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But you ain&#8217;t sore at the way I asked, are you?
I had to begin somewhere, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sore?&#8221; rejoined his companion, angrily.
&#8220;Sore? I&#8217;m so sore that I&#8217;m going out after Tex
right now. And I&#8217;ll get him or know the reason
why, too. You go back and post your men about
this&#8211;and tell them on no account to ride over my
range for a few days, for they might get hurt
before they are known. Put a couple of them
to bed as soon as you get back&#8211;you need them
to keep watch nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned toward the corral and called to a
man who was busy near it: &#8220;Charley, you take
anybody that you want and get in a good sleep
before nightfall. I will want both of you to work
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, after dinner will be time enough,&#8221;
Charley replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take Lefty Lukins.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Orphan went into the ranch house and
returned at once with his rifle, a canteen of water
and a package of food. As he threw a saddle on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381'></a>381</span>
his horse Bill galloped up, waving his arms and
very much excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Orphant!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s
shore enough plugged some of our cows near the
creek! I lost his trail at the Cottonwoods!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Bill,&#8221; replied the foreman, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
out and look them over. You take another horse
and ride to the Star C. Tell Blake to keep watch
for Tex Williard, and tell him to hold Tex for me
if he sees him. Lively, Bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill stared, leaped from his horse, took the saddle
from its back and was soon lost to sight in the
corral. In a few minutes he galloped past his
foreman and Sneed swearing heartily. His quirt
arose and fell and soon he was lost to sight over a
rise near the ranch-house.</p>

<p>The foreman of the A-Y rode over to Charley:
&#8220;Charley, in case I don&#8217;t get back to-night, you
and Lefty keep guard somewhere out here, and
shoot any man who don&#8217;t halt at your hail. If I
return in the dark I&#8217;ll whistle Dixie as soon as
I see the lights in the bunk house, and I&#8217;ll keep
it up so you won&#8217;t mistake me. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sneed and he cantered away together and soon
they parted, the former to ride toward his ranch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382'></a>382</span>
the latter toward the Cottonwoods near the Limping
Water and along the trail left by Bill.</p>

<p>When near the grove The Orphan saw five dead
cows and he quickly dismounted to examine them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not dead for long,&#8221; he muttered as he examined
the blood on them. He leaped into his saddle
and galloped through the grove. &#8220;Now, by
God, somebody pays for them!&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>Here was a sudden change in things, positions
had been reversed, and now he could appreciate
the feelings which he had, more than once, aroused
in the hearts of numerous foremen. He emerged
from the grove and rode rapidly along the trail
left by the perpetrator, alert, grim and angry.
Soon the trail dipped beneath the waters of the
creek and he stopped and thought for a few seconds.
If it was Tex, he would not have ridden
toward the Cross Bar-8 and the town, and neither
would he have ridden south toward the Star C,
nor north in the direction of the A-Y. He would
seek cover for the day if he was still determined
to carry on his game, and would not emerge until
night covered his movements. That left him only
the west along the creek, and more than that, the
creek turned to the south again about five miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383'></a>383</span>
farther on and flowed far too close to the ranch-houses
of the Star C for safety. He must have
left the water at the turn, and toward the turn
rode The Orphan, watching intently for the trail
to emerge on either bank. His deductions were
sound, for when he had rounded the bend of the
stream he picked up the trail where it left the
water and followed it westward.</p>

<p>The country around the bend was very wild and
rough, for ravines between the hills cut seams and
gashes in the plain. The underbrush was shoulder
high, and he did not know how soon he might
become a target. The trail was very fresh in the
soft loam of the ravines and the broken branches
and trampled leaves were still wet with sap. Soon
he hobbled his horse and proceeded on foot, but
to one side of and parallel with the trail. He had
spent an hour in his advance and had begun to
regret having left his horse so early, when he
heard the report of a gun near at hand and a bullet
hissed viciously over his head as he stooped to go
under a low branch.</p>

<p>He threw up his arms, the rifle falling from his
hands, pitched forward and rolled down the side
of the hill and behind a fallen tree trunk which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384'></a>384</span>
lay against a thicket. As soon as he had gained
this position he glanced in the direction from
whence the shot had come and, finding himself
screened from sight on that side, quickly jerked
off his boots and planted them among the bushes,
where they looked as if he had crawled in almost
out of sight. That done, he crawled along the
ground under the protection of the tree trunk and
then squirmed under it, when he pushed himself,
feet first, deep into a tangled thicket and waited,
Colt in hand, for a sign of his enemy&#8217;s approach.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour had passed in silence when
a shot, followed by another, sounded from the
hillside. After the lapse of a like interval another
shot was fired, this time from the opposite direction.
He saw a twig fall by the boots and heard
the spat! of the bullet as it hit a stone. Two more
shots sounded in rapid succession, and then another
long interval of silence. Half an hour passed, but
he was not impatient. He most firmly believed
that his man would, sooner or later, come out to
examine the boots, and time was of no consequence:
he wanted the man.</p>

<p>Whoever he was, he was certainly cautious, he
did not believe in taking any chances. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385'></a>385</span>
almost certain that he would not leave until he
had been assured that he had accomplished his
purpose, for it would be most disconcerting at
some future time to unexpectedly meet the man
he thought he had murdered. Another shot
whizzed into the place where the body should have
been, according to the silent testimony of the boots.
It sounded much closer to the thicket, but in the
same direction of the last few shots. Then, after
ten minutes of silence, a twig snapped, and directly
behind the thicket in which The Orphan was hidden!
The foreman&#8217;s nerves were tense now, his
every sense was alert, for his was a most dangerous
position. He quickly glanced over his shoulder
into the thicket and found that he could not penetrate
the mass of leaves and branches, which reassured
him. He was very glad that he had forced
himself well into the cover, for soon the leaves
rustled and a pebble rolled not more than four feet
off, and in front of him, slightly at his right. More
rustling and then a head and shoulder slowly
pushed past him into view. The man moved very
slowly and cautiously and was crouched, his head
far in advance of his waist. The Orphan could
see only one side of the face, the angle of the man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386'></a>386</span>
jaw and an ear, but that was enough, for he knew
the owner. Slowly and without a sound the foreman&#8217;s
right hand turned at the wrist until the Colt
gleamed on a line with the other&#8217;s heart. The
searcher leaned forward and to one side, that he
might better see the boots, when a sound met his
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move,&#8221; whispered the foreman.</p>

<p>The prowler stiffened in his tracks, frozen to
rigidity by the command. Then he slowly turned
his head and looked squarely into the gun of the
man he thought he had killed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christ!&#8221; he cried hoarsely, starting back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon you&#8217;ll ever know Him,&#8221; said
The Orphan, his voice very low and monotonous.
&#8220;Stand just as you are&#8211;don&#8217;t move&#8211;I want to
talk with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex simply stared at him in pitiful helplessness
and could not speak, beads of perspiration standing
out on his face, testifying to the agony of fear
he was in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on the wrong side of the game again,
Tex,&#8221; The Orphan said slowly, watching the
puncher narrowly, his gun steady as a rock. &#8220;You
still want to kill me, it seems. I&#8217;ve given you your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387'></a>387</span>
life twice, once to your knowledge, and I told you
with the sheriff that I would shoot you if you ever
returned; and still you have come back to have
me do it. You were not satisfied to let things rest
as they were.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex did not reply, and The Orphan continued,
a flicker of contempt about his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were never cast for an outlaw, Tex. If
I do say it myself, it takes a clever man to live at
that game, and I know, for I&#8217;ve been all through
it. As you see, Sneed and I didn&#8217;t shoot each
other, for the play was too plain, too transparent.
You should have ambushed one of his men, burned
his corrals and slaughtered his cattle, for then he
might have shot and talked later. And he might
have gotten me, too, for I was unsuspecting. I
don&#8217;t say that I would kill an innocent man to
arouse his anger if I had been in your place, I&#8217;m
only showing you where you made the mistake,
where you blundered. Had you killed one of his
men it is very probable that his rage would have
known no bounds, but as it was the provocation
was not great enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex remained silent and unconsciously toyed at
his ear. The Orphan looked keenly at the movement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388'></a>388</span>
and wondered where he had seen it before,
for it was familiar. His face darkened as memory
urged something forward to him out of the dark
catacombs of the past, and he stilled his breathing
to catch a clue to it. He saw the little ranch his
father had worked so hard over to improve, and
had fought hard to save, and then the picture of
his dying mother came vividly before him; but still
something avoided his searching thoughts, something
barely eluded him, trembling on the edge of
the Then and Now. He saw his father&#8217;s body
slowly swinging and turning in the light breeze of
a perfect day, and he quivered at the nearness of
what he was seeking, its proximity was tantalizing.
The rope!&#8211;the rope about his father&#8217;s neck had
been of manila fiber; he could never forget the
soiled, bleached-yellow streak which had led upward
to Eternity. And manila ropes were, at that
time, a rarity in that part of the country, for rawhide
and braided-hair lariats had been the rule.
And on the day when he had given Tex his life in
the defile he had noticed the faded yellow rope
which had swung at the puncher&#8217;s saddle horn.
As he strained with renewed hope to catch the
elusive impression another scene came before him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389'></a>389</span>
It was of three men bent over a cow, engaged in
blotting out his father&#8217;s brand, and instantly the
face of one of them sprang into sharp definition
on his mental canvas.</p>

<p>&#8220;D<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>n you!&#8221; he cried, his finger tightening
on the trigger of the Colt which for so many years
had been his best friend. &#8220;I know you now,
changed as you are! Now I know why you have
been so determined for my death. On the day
that I cut my father down I swore that I would kill
the man who had lynched him if kind fate let me
find him, and I have found him. You have just
five minutes to live, so make the most of it, you
cowardly murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tex&#8217;s face went suddenly white again and his
nerve deserted him. His Colt was in his hand,
but oh, so useless! Should he fight to the end?
A shudder ran through him at the thought, for
life was so good, so precious; far too precious to
waste a minute of it by dying before his time was
up. Perhaps the foreman would relent, perhaps
he would become so wrapped up in the memories
of the years gone by as to forget, just for half a
second, where he was. The watch in The
Orphan&#8217;s hand gave him hope, for he would wait
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390'></a>390</span>
until the other glanced at it&#8211;that would be his
only hope of life.</p>

<p>The foreman&#8217;s watch ticked loudly in the palm
of his left hand and the Colt in his right never
quivered. The first minute passed in terrifying
silence, then the second, then the third, but all the
time The Orphan&#8217;s eyes stared steadily at the man
before him, gray, cruel, unblinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me to do it! They told me to do
it!&#8221; shrieked the pitiful, unnerved wreck of a
man as he convulsively opened and shut his hand.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to do it! I swear I didn&#8217;t want to
do it! As God is above, I didn&#8217;t want to! They
made me, they made me!&#8221; he cried, his words
swiftly becoming an unintelligible jumble of meaningless
sounds. He stared at the black muzzle of
the Colt, frozen by terror, fascinated by horror
and deadened by despair. The watch ticked on
in maddening noise, for his every sense was now
most acute, beating in upon his brain like the
strokes of a hammer. Then the foreman glanced
quickly at it. The gun in Tex&#8217;s hand leaped up,
but not quickly enough, and a spurt of smoke
enveloped his face as he fell. The Orphan
stepped back, dropping the Colt into its holster.</p>

&#8220;The Orphan stepped back a pace and dropped<br />the Colt into its holster.&#8221; (<i>See page</i> 390.)
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391'></a>391</span>&#8220;The courage of despair!&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m glad he died game,&#8221; he slowly added.
Then he suddenly buried his face in his hands:
&#8220;Helen!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Helen&#8211;forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392'></a>392</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GREAT HAPPINESS</span></h2>

<p><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE town was rapidly losing sharpness of detail, for the straggling
buildings were becoming more and more blurred and
were growing into sharp silhouettes in the increasing
dusk, and the sickly yellow lights were growing
more numerous in the scattered windows.</p>

<p>Helen moved about the dining-room engaged
in setting the table and she had just placed fresh
flowers in the vase, when she suddenly stopped
and listened. Faintly to her ears came the pounding
hoofbeats of a galloping horse on the well-packed
street, growing rapidly nearer with portentous
speed. It could not be Miss Ritchie, for
there was a vast difference between the comparatively
lazy gallop of her horse and the pulse-stirring
tattoo which she now heard. The hoofbeats
passed the corner without slackening pace, and
whirled up the street, stopping in front of the
house with a suddenness which she had long since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393'></a>393</span>
learned to attribute to cowboys. She stood still,
afraid to go to the door, numbed with a nameless
fear&#8211;something terrible must have happened,
perhaps to The Orphan. The rider ran up the
path, his spurs jingling sharply, leaped to the
porch, and the door was dashed open to show him
standing before her, sombrero in hand, his quirt
dangling from his left wrist. He was dusty and
tired, but the expression on his face terrified her,
held her speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen!&#8221; he cried hoarsely, driving her fear
deeper into her heart by his altered voice.
&#8220;Helen!&#8221; She trembled, and he made a gesture
of hopelessness and involuntarily stepped toward
her, letting the door swing shut behind him. He
stood just within the room, rigidly erect, his eyes
meeting hers in the silence of strong emotion.
Breathlessly she retreated as he advanced, as if
instinct warned her of what he had to tell her,
until the table was between them; and a spasm of
pain flickered across his face as he noticed it, leaving
him hard and stern again, but in his eyes was
a look of despair, a keen misery which softened
her and drew her toward him even while she feared
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394'></a>394</span>The silence became unbearable and at last she
could endure it no longer. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; she
breathed, tensely. &#8220;What have you to tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes never wavered from her face, fascinated
in despair of what he must read there, much
as he dreaded it, and he answered her from between
set lips, much as a man would pronounce his
own death sentence. &#8220;I have broken my word,&#8221;
he said, harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Broken your word&#8211;to me?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face brightened and was softened by a
child-like wonder, for she felt relieved in a degree,
and unconsciously she moved nearer to him.
&#8220;What is it&#8211;what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>He regarded her without appraising the change
in her expression and his reply was as harsh and
stern as his first statement, accompanied by no
excuses nor words of extenuation. &#8220;I have killed
a man,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A shiver passed over her and her eyes went
closed for a moment. The great choice was at
hand now, and in her heart a fierce, short battle
raged; on one side was arrayed her early training,
all her teachings, all regard for the ideas of law
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395'></a>395</span>
and order which she had absorbed in the East,
where human life was safeguarded as the first
necessity; and on the other was the Unwritten Law
of the range as exemplified by The Orphan. Blood,
and human blood, was precious, and her early
environment fought bitterly against this regime of
direct justice, so startlingly driven into her mind
by his bold, cold admission. And then, he had
sinned in this way again after he had promised
her not to do so. The last thought dominated her
and she opened her eyes and looked at him
hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said, eagerly, &#8220;perhaps you
could not avoid it&#8211;perhaps you were forced to
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You did not&#8211;you did not
shoot him down without warning! I <i>know</i> you
didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;And, besides,
this was his third offense. Twice I have given him
his life, and I would have done so again but for
what I discovered after I faced him.&#8221; He paused
for a moment and then continued, with more feeling
in his voice, a ring of victory and an irrepressible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396'></a>396</span>
elation. &#8220;I found that he was the man for
whom I have been looking for fifteen years, and
whom I had sworn to kill. He killed my father,
killed him like a dog and without a chance for
life, hung him to a tree on his own land. And
when I learned that, when he had confessed to me,
I forgot the new game, I forgot everything but
the watch in my hand slowly ticking away his life,
the time I had given him to make his peace with
God&#8211;and I hated the slow seconds, I begrudged
him every movement of the hands. Then I shot
him, and I was glad, so glad&#8211;but oh, dear! If
you&#8211;if you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice wavered and broke and he dropped
to his knees before her with bowed head as she
came slowly toward him and seized the hem of
her gown in both hands, kissing it passionately,
burying his face in its folds like a tired boy at his
mother&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>Her eyes were filled with tears and they rimmed
her lashes as she looked down on the man at her
feet. Bending, she touched him and then placed
her hands on his head, tenderly kissing the tangled
hair in loving forgiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear boy,&#8221; she murmured softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397'></a>397</span>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t, dear heart. Don&#8217;t, you must not&#8211;oh,
you must not! Please&#8211;come with me; get up,
dear, and sit with me over here in the corner; then
you shall tell me all about it. I am sure you have
not done wrong&#8211;and if you have&#8211;don&#8217;t you
know I love you, boy? Don&#8217;t you know I love
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stirred slightly, as if awakening from a
troubled sleep, and slowly raised his head and
looked at her with doubt in his eyes, for it was so
much like a dream&#8211;perhaps it was one. But he
saw a light on her face, a light which a man sees
only on the face of one woman and which blinds
him against all other lights forever. Then it was
true, all true&#8211;he had heard aright! &#8220;Helen!&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;Helen!&#8221; and the ring in his voice
brought new tears to her eyes. He sprang to his
feet, tense, eager, all his nerves tingling, and his
quirt hissed through the air and snapped a defiance,
a warning to the world as he clasped her to
him. &#8220;I <i>knew</i>, I <i>knew!</i>&#8221; he cried passionately.
&#8220;In my heart I <i>knew</i> you were a thoroughbred!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tilted her head back, but she laughed low
with delight and eluded him, leading him to a
chair, the chair he had occupied on the occasion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398'></a>398</span>
of his first visit, and then drew a low, rough footrest
beside him and seated herself at his feet, her
elbows resting on his knees and her chin in her
hands. He looked down into the upturned face
and then glanced swiftly about the homelike room
and back to her face again. She snuggled tightly
against his knees and waited patiently for his story.</p>

<p>He sighed contentedly and touched her cheek
reverently and then told her all of the story of Tex
Williard, from the very beginning to the very end,
from the time he had seen Tex bending over one
of his father&#8217;s cows to the last scene in the thicket.
When he had finished, Helen took his head between
her hands, pressing it warmly as she nodded wisely
to show that she understood. He looked deep
into her eyes and then suddenly bent his head until
his lips touched her ear: &#8220;Helen, darling,&#8221; he
whispered, &#8220;how long must I wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you scamp!&#8221; she exclaimed, teasingly,
threatening to draw away from him. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t even told me that you love me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed her hands tightly and laughed aloud,
joyously, filled with an elated, effervescent gladness
which surged over him in waves of delight:
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I? Oh, but you know better, dear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399'></a>399</span>
Many and many times I have told you that, and
in many ways, and you knew it and understood.
You never doubted it, and I hope,&#8221; he added seriously,
&#8220;that you never will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never will, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not hear Grace Ritchie in the kitchen,
did not hear her quiet step as it crossed the
threshold and stopped, and then tiptoed to the
rear door and sped lightly around the house to
the street, and down it to where Mrs. Shields and
Mary were walking toward the house. They did
not know that half an hour had passed since the
coming of the quiet step and the three women, and
that the supper was hopelessly ruined. They knew
nothing&#8211;and Everything: they had learned the
Great Happiness.</p>
